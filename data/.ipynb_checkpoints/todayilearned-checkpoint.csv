Even when returning artifacts it can be complicated what you should give back.

So it's all made me question what dogs we label as intelligent. We tend to label the smart dogs as the ones that listen to people and obey commands.

&gt;  It was mostly welded together, but if an exposed rivet-head wouldn‚Äôt adversely cause an effect on the top speed, it was left as-is.

The Mig 25 had been created of mostly steel, to catch high flying SR-71 and corresponding planned US bombers (XB-70). The US saw the big wings, and tracked a jet going at Mach 3.2 and thought the USSR was creating an uber maneuvrable A2A fighter like the US was doing/planning. Later after the defection, it was realized that it was more of a straight line interceptor and that the Mach 3.2 flight had destroyed the engines",barath_s,1635353592

It turns out that the [Nene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Nene) was a [centrifugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_compressor) flow jet engine, which was seen as a dead end. The UK had [axial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_compressor) flow tech which was more compact and could be scaled to multiple stages. The Nene

todayilearned,"&gt; An example of wording related to this is ""if you can't say anything positive, you'll be blocked"" in response to any form of disagreement. The downfall is that now this person is only surrounded by people who agree with them, rather than a diversity of views, which can lead to polarization.

I do this, not outright in my profile on Instagram or anything, I just [don't check my reddit notifications](https://i.imgur.com/0oGVYwk.png) and sort my profile by top of the last 24 hours when I feel like replying to discussions. It's not because I want to be agreed with, I don't want an echo chamber, I just know that the internet is a place full of vitriol, insults, and kneejerk downvotes because people don't like what others have to say. I don't come to reddit to feel bad about myself and my opinions, and oftentimes the same opinion can differ greatly between posts within the same community, let alone when switching subreddits. I've asked questions that I thought were harmless because the reasoning I gave was common knowledge in a community focused around that particular subject, but when I bring it up in a more broad one my comment gets downvote-buried, and at that point I hardly want to click the comment chain and see what the replies were because there's a 50/50 that people either answered my question and merely pointed out something I hadn't considered or they're calling me ""fucking stupid"" or something. I'm hardly a saint myself and I need to work on how I react and respond to things (which would probably clean up how people respond to me), but I would argue that if even moderated social media like reddit can have as much scummy trash talk as it does, traditional cesspool socials probably distort people's vision of disagreement over time because no matter what opinion you give someone is going to disagree and there's usually not any simple community dividing like here where people who don't care about gaming can simply not subscribe to a gaming subreddit.

So secure that suicide rates among doctors are disproportionately high, right? But what's more telling is that you think that ""one of the highest paid and secure professions in the world"" should have completely unnecessary hardship and cruelty attached to it. What, it's not an issue of whos the smartest or best medical student, what matters is their ability to put in the 21st through 23rd straight hour for peanuts? This is peacetime, not Fallujah '06. 

&gt;This obviously isn't going to be the popular opinion in this thread filled with many of said-residents and med professionals. But that doesn't mean I'm not going to point out that the majority of the world thinks you're pathetic or stupid.

The upvotes are going to others and the downvotes are going to you. Are you misinformed what the phrase ""majority of the world thinks""?

(Note: if you go to ""reddit is biased here"", remember that most of the world doesn't put its doctors through all this stress.)

&gt;I think you know that though, or you'd have no problem complaining about how hard your poor career is to primary school teachers or EMTs that don't have reason to placate you with ""yeah you're right"".

My career is so laughably easy that anyone with basic English skills can do it. And, that's the way I like it. If I wanted to be entrusted with human lives regularly, I'd have become a doctor. 

Of course, my noble reason to be a doctor will go into the toilet as I have to undergo torturous hours for this. Why does a peacetime need its best and brightest to suffer excessively? Furthermore, why should someone's life be placed in a hands of some rookie who's explicitly being overworked and underpaid? Doesn't the quality of care matter to you?

In fact, fuck being a doctor. Smart people should go into investment banking and steal from people for a living. Maybe that's why this country's so fucked up?

But no, you disagree. This country is fucked up because people just won't tolerate the cruelty that is there to weed them out.

And the average shooting is by a relatively low-powered handgun. They could easily tell if someone was killed with a sniper rifle. The wounds look nothing alike. Not to mention it was EASILY verifiable when people were shot from the Danziger bridge by those lunatics, so it should be just as verifiable if people were supposedly sniped from the superdome.

Not to mention the fact that those other things turned out to be true doesn't make Kyle's claim any more true.

As a result, his feelings on the story can only be speculated. But considering Tolkien was so adept at creating living, breathing worlds with real-world themes, it creates curiosity over why he disliked something equally as layered.

In some ways, *Dune* could be read as a deconstruction of *LotR*‚Äôs themes and storyline. Both feature a ‚Äúchosen one‚Äù type hero with an aristocratic lineage who is cast into the wilderness, finds allies among a disregarded people, defeats a powerful, malevolent enemy, and reclaims his ancient birthright. But in *LotR*, the outcome depends on the main characters‚Äô personal choices and sacrifices, and the end result is a just and benevolent reign by the restored hero. In *Dune*, the hero realizes his future reign is going to be an apocalyptic bloodbath, and that nothing he can do will stop it.

My objection would be that using a ""lottocracy"" would not be worse than what's happening nowdays in a lot of countries, US included, it doesn't really matter anymore who are the elected ones... they all look stupid, vindictive and more concerned with their own well-being than learning or doing their supposed job.

An interesting fact that most people missed (probably becuse they didn't know what was the ""Sortition"":

It was used ONLY for specific public functions: Magistrates and Juries.

IMHO it was better to have judges and ""accusers/defenders"" to be assigned randomly instead of having a ""fixed position"" to hold.

In Athens, to be eligible to be chosen by lot, citizens self-selected themselves into the available pool, then lotteries in the kleroteria machines. The magistracies assigned by lot generally had terms of service of 1 year. A citizen could not hold any particular magistracy more than once in his lifetime, but could hold other magistracies. All male citizens over 30 years of age, who were not disenfranchised by atimia, were eligible. Those selected through lot underwent examination called dokimasia in order to avoid incompetent officials. Rarely were selected citizens discarded.[11] Magistrates, once in place, were subjected to constant monitoring by the Assembly. Magistrates appointed by lot had to render account of their time in office upon their leave, called euthynai. However, any citizen could request the suspension of a magistrate with due reason",scavenger22,1635349722

First, for quite a while I wasn't old enough to donate blood, since I'm pretty sure you have to be 18 to do it here.

Second, I normally lived in a place where there isn't a donation clinic, so it just wasn't possible to donate blood from the get-go. But my cousin got married over the summer and I attended the ceremony in Vancouver, which of course has tons of donation clinics. 

Then I was asked about 50 questions about my medical history, travel history, and who I sleep with. I realize this is so that they're not taking blood from people with HIV, hepatitis or variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (aka mad cow disease) or other weird diseases, so fair enough. Then I basically had a sort of personal interview because I was a first time donor and they went over my answers. I passed, so all I've gotta do is get a small sample of blood taken and my temperature measured. Then I get to spend some time with an IV in my arm as it drains some blood.

I got rejected because my temperature was too high - a classic symptom of virtually any infection, not just COVID - and among other things. Normally in such a scenario they'd let you sit down and try to cool off but because of COVID and physical distancing protocols they just turned away anyone whose temperature is too high for any, even though we both knew the reason why my temperature was too high - it was a hot summer day in July, obviously my body temperature is going to be higher than normal.

Pre-covid, there would absolutely be down times where work was harder to come by. So you always in the back of your head have to remember that you need to be prepared financially for lean times when they come around. Los Angeles isn‚Äôt cheap to live, and it‚Äôs not exactly a line of work I can move to a cheap area of the country and expect to have a job. There‚Äôs not a lot of warning when things slow, and sometimes your friends are non stop working but for whatever reason your phone isn‚Äôt ringing. So you develop a healthy fear of the slow time and that keeps you working. As a crew member, I‚Äôm making 5 figures a year. We aren‚Äôt millionaires, we are blue collar, middle class workers.

Secondly, our benefits are directly tied to the amount of hours we work. I need to work 400 hours every quarter to keep my health insurance, and I need 60,000 hours worked to retire with full pension (roughly 30 years). If I fail to work those 400 hours, my insurance will drop me. Which is super fun knowing if I get cancer or something that takes me out of work for a significant amount of time, my insurance will drop me when I need the coverage most, but that‚Äôs a topic for another time. 

Finally, I mentioned somewhere that I can‚Äôt remember the last time I touched my resume, that my jobs come from people I know calling me or people I know recommending me. Turning guys down too many times does run you the risk of simply not being called anymore as they expect you‚Äôll say no. If they know you‚Äôre on a show, it‚Äôs understandable.

todayilearned,"Hokkaido was colonized by the Japanese only in the late 19th century. It's a bit shocking to think that, when Americans were colonizing the West, displacing Native tribes to settle new lands, the Japanese were ALSO colonizing the North, displacing Native tribes to settle new lands. There's more than a bit of similarity, though the climate was much different (Hokkaido is more like Japan's Canada).

Plus, Japan just opening up, it followed many of the practices of the Americans. So for example, Dallas and Sapporo (Hokkaido's largest city) are actually built on a similar grid of wide streets in their downtown area, because both followed North American practices of the day when they were founded.

The Japanese however had a policy of strict assimilation of the native peoples they colonized, be it the Ainu or the Okinawans. They basically came along and said ""you people are just wayward Japanese, your language is just a degraded dialect of true Japanese (not true), so we're not alienating you from your own culture, we're just making sure you return to your proper Japanese culture and speak proper Japanese"". So they banned traditional names and the old language and forced them to take Japanese names and speak Japanese in school.

What I am replying to directly is the claim that giving the government little to no power to make regulations is bad, and not able to fix the topic at hand. That making sure the gov has less power means that corporations won't try and be awful because they now cannot petition the government to give them some sort of legally binding monopoly or contract or biased law. That is just dumb.

What you want is more accountability, less dumb regulation, regulations that need to be updated regularly or analyzed, and to break that fucking government to corperate cycle top people do. Businesses should be able to petition the government, I see the value in having industry experience lend their expertise, but they shouldn't be writing it. 

And you can't make a perfect law that stops all mixing and dealing, but you can put in place restrictions, create systems to check, and increase civil engagement in education, increase funding for ethics and moral classes, you can make things more public. 

The answer isn't to define the government, or to try and change a businesses nature (which is people's nature). You want to try and corral it, remove as many chokepoints for temptation, for fuckery, and constantly try and improve it.

I was not ready to practice in my specialty until I did a residency. There is no substitute for experience and seeing thousands of patients. It wasn‚Äôt the extra Med school that made me a solid doctor, it was residency. Im adamant that they should not be able to practice independently. I also am 100% for safe staffing which includes time to safely supervise NPP‚Äôs. 

I am lucky and I work with a lot of solid non physician providers. They are good because they know what they don‚Äôt know (also important for physicians). I cannot safely supervise all their patients on my shift (yet I have liability for them) because contracting groups hire a bunch of them and just one physician. 

I also think that right now, you‚Äôll get much better training as a PA. NP schools have often become diploma mills.

Japan as a state goes back to at least the 3rd century AD, and there is documented evidence of at least one Chinese tributary state existing before then. While this state certainly did not have control over the entire Japanese archipelago, they were a recognized state that became the Japan we know today. 

I'm not sure what you mean by Shokugawa Era, which is something I've never heard of. You probably mean the Edo era (or Edo-jidai). The period following unification under the Tokugawa Shogunate.

However, the Tokugawa shogunate isn't the emergence of the Japanese state as an entity, as once again the Japanese state had existed in different capacities at least a thousand years prior. However, an increasingly decentralized and feudal system of fiefdoms (beginning in the 12th century) lead to the fractured state of affairs most popularly known as the Warring States period (or Sengoku-jidai). Yet , even during this period, the nominal authority of the emperor did exist. And these autonomous fiefdoms acknowledged themselves (at least publicly) as servants of that same emperor.

Across this time, as the central authority of the Emperor rose and fell, many Japanese armies engaged in warfare against other indigenous peoples. The Emishi an early casualty and later the Ainu.",veremos,1635344063

""From 1799 to 1806, the shogunate took direct control of southern Hokkaid≈ç. During this period, Ainu women were separated from their husbands and either subjected to rape or forcibly married to Japanese men, while Ainu men were deported to merchant subcontractors for five and ten-year terms of service. Policies of family separation and assimilation, combined with the impact of smallpox, caused the Ainu population to drop significantly in the early 19th century. In the 18th century, there were 80,000 Ainu. In 1868, there were about 15,000 Ainu in Hokkaid≈ç, 2000 in Sakhalin and around 100 in the Kuril islands.""

todayilearned,"This is about plasma donation in the United States.

There are two kinds of plasma donations:  paid and unpaid.

I'll describe the unpaid first.  An unpaid plasma donation is usually part of a whole blood donation, then separated off to yield three products:  plasma, platelets and red blood cells.  The plasma may be used to separate out certain proteins which are concentrated to produce cryoprecipitate.  Cryoprecipitate is sometimes known as ""tissue glue"", because it can be used in certain surgical procedures to ""glue"" things together.  Cryoprecipitate consists mostly of proteins called coagulation factors and fibrinogen.  Most plasma from unpaid donations is retained and used as plasma, which is needed in massive transfusions and plasmapheresis as well as other treatments.  The plasma used in this manner needs to be free of pathogens and red blood cell alloantibodies.  The presence of certain antibodies against certain diseases (e.g. HIV, Hepatitis C) disqualify the plasma for use in transfusion.

Paid plasma donations are usually plasmapheresis donations, where the red blood cells and platelets are separated out and returned to the donor.  Here, the presence of certain antibodies can be a bonus.  Someone with anti-D, like James Harrison, has plasma that is useful for the production of RhoGam, the product used to protect the fetuses of Rh negative mothers until they are sufficiently mature to be born and survive.  RhoGam works (presumably) by binding to any Rh positive fetal red blood cells that escape into maternal circulation, thus sending those cells directly to the spleen to be destroyed and recycled.  If the fetal Rh positive cells remained in the mother's blood, they could trigger an immune reaction which could eventually kill the fetus, and do the same with all future pregnancies.  

In the event the paid plasma donor has other antibodies which might potentially disqualify him or her from donating, that plasma, if it has an antibody like anti-D, can still be used to produce reagents essential for blood typing.  There is also more to blood typing than ABO and Rh, and this is where donors may receive extra compensation for their plasma.  If a donor has an antibody to another red blood cell antigen like K, C, e, JkA or about 100 others, that antibody can be harvested and used to make useful reagents for blood typing.

Another thing that can increase plasma donor compensation is the presence of antibodies to certain diseases or exposures.  For example, someone who has had the rabies or hepatitis B vaccine probably has antibodies to that disease.  That plasma can then be used to make immunoglobulins used to treat an unvaccinated exposed individual.  In the rabies example, those immunoglobulins are injected around the bite site to hopefully prevent the virus in the wound from spreading further and buying time for the patient's post-exposure vaccine to cause an appropriate immune response.  Of course this sort of antibody can also be purified and used to make reagents to detect the disease of interest.

Aaanyways, donated unpaid plasma is usually used directly in plasma transfusions.  Paid plasma donations are usually used to make certain medical products and reagents.",tfarnon59,1635342141

Another thing is that samples might be pooled for some tests but not for others. Here is an article from 2010 (the latest one I could find on a quick Google search, sorry) where one region in Germany has started testing samples for HIV individually, at the time the first one to do so in Germany: https://www.aerztezeitung.de/Medizin/Blutspendedienst-testet-jede-Spende-einzeln-auf-HIV-und-Hepatitis-216951.html

DeepL translation:

With the tests, blood transfusions and blood products made from donor blood will become even safer, Dr. Ernst-Markus Quenzel, Medical Director of the Munich Blood Donor Service, emphasised. As he reminded a press conference at his institution, the critical time window has already been dramatically reduced by direct pathogen detection with PCR-based detection methods instead of the serological antibody or antigen testing that was common in the past. The window refers to the period of time between the potential infection of a donor and the point in time at which detection of infection in the blood is possible.

However, for the direct pathogen screening of donor blood in Germany, the testing of pools, in which samples from up to 96 donors are combined, is still the standard, Peter Kanzler from Novartis clarified at the event. Dilution effects accepted with pooling favour that a newly infected person with a still low pathogen concentration escapes even very sensitive PCR-based detection methods. This risk is significantly reduced by single-donor testing. With the Procleix¬Æ Ultrio Plus¬Æ test, a new module of the PROCLEIX¬Æ TIGRIS¬Æ system from Novartis, individual blood samples could be tested for HIV, HCV and HBV fully automatically and thus very sensitively with relatively little work.

According to statistical model analyses, this rational individual donor testing reduces the critical time window from infection to detectability from 7.4 to 4.9 days on average for HCV, from 9.0 to 5.6 days for HIV and from 32.3 to 24.6 days for HBV compared to established pool testing.",Lilcrash,1635341719

Every two weeks, with proper nurses doing it and rotating sites will likely not leave a mark unless he's very bad at healing. You can't hit the exact same spot for that long because it will degrade the vein and make it impossible to hit anymore. They didn't want that so they clearly were carefully caring for his veins to avoid scaring. If there's scaring on the outside there's scaring on the inside, and that can compromise a whole vein. No veins mean he can no longer donate. The two weeks in between likely gave him ample time to heal properly as well.",xombae,1635341048

But this is a well studied scenario, and it has been demonstrated experimentally that surgeons are, in fact, less impaired than non-surgeons by limited sleep compared to other physicians.

Surgeons do suffer impairment of peak performance when sleep deprived, but they are less prone than others to have performance in terms of dexterity and decision-making suffer to a degree that compromises adequacy. 

Also, surgeons are selected, groomed, and trained to a much different degree of competency than other types of physicians. It is one of the few pyramidal training scenarios left where they actually cut you for incompetence.  One in four categorically selected trainees doesn‚Äôt complete training to become a surgeon and multitudes more are never allowed the opportunity and only do the first two years of training in a preliminary designation and are forced to do something else if they don‚Äôt get the position of one of the fallouts. So all that being said, in some respects the competence of an impaired surgeon may still far exceed the competence of an unimpaired physician of another role because they are just functioning on a whole other level of expectations.",onacloverifalive,1635340990

i would also say that donate blood for money is culturally taboo because the red cross and different groups (some good, some less so) entities has tried to persuade people they should be willing to do it without compensation. but in communities that need the money, the money can be extremely helpful.

todayilearned,"Interesting. In some parts of the US, the saline primarily is just used to rehydrate after the 100-800ml loss/donation of plasma. Same rules basically apply here as the UK though. However certain personal have the ability to administer certain care to people having adverse reactions. 

For example cramps cause by citrate reaction can be solved by giving the person simple antacid chews. Or if someone passes out we can elevate their legs, hold their arm down to prevent hematoma as they convulse/awake from passing out. Saline is usually the best thing for someone having a reaction. At least immediately while they‚Äôre still hooked up. If you lose a good reinfusion site due to a needle infiltrating the vein, it can be wayy harder for them to recover without IV fluids. 

Of course we prioritize safety and call it quits immediately if these things happen. Sometimes however, we have to keep them stable enough before disconnecting to at least get them the Saline so they actually come out of the reaction fast. This way it‚Äôs usually never something that actually causes any harm or stops them from going about their day normally afterwards.
