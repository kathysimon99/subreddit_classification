First is what is known as electron-migration.  This is how semi conductors overtime lose the semi-part and stop being able to open and close the electron gates used in transistors.  This is the reason why SSDs have a defined number of read/write uses.  Additionally this can result in the micro traces used in CPUs to crack and prevent the flow of electrons.

Second is thermal cracking.  Over time the constant heating then cooling of the cpu components can result in the traces to eventually break over time.  Think like a rock going through the expansion and contraction over heating and cooling cycles.  The same thing happens inside of CPUs.

Obviously its very difficult to know for sure if an ancestor sequence that you have reconstructed is truly representative of the past but there are number of methods one might use to make an educated guess.

For example you could assume the ancestral DNA or Amino Acid sequence could be the one which would require the least number of changes to see all your extant sequences today.

You could take a markov chain approach where you assign probabilities for one base pair or amino acid to change from one to another. e.g. for DNA,  |0.1 A--&gt;C |  0.05 A--&gt;G| 0.01 A--&gt;T | 0.84 A--&gt; A| etc, (i pulled these numbers out of my ass)

askscience,"This requires a very long answer, but I'll try to give you a short one. It will probably attract corrections ;)

Most of the time, cells performing a fonction are specialized cells that can't divide (in turn increasing their numbers). Specialized cells are the daughters of stem cells (called multi- pluri- and toti-potent cells). When stem cells divide, some of the offspring specializes, aka differentiating ( eg becoming a muscle cell performing the action of contraction, aka muscle fiber) and some of the offspring remain an undifferentiated stem cell. The differentiating offspring can replace lost cells, or increase a cell populations number (in the muscle example, regenerate a muscle or become an additional fiber making the muscle bigger).
However, stem cells generally don't remain undifferentiated forever, and can't forever produce replacement or additional cells. Stem cells eventually die off as well, especially after having divided several times. A cell population then loses its capacity to replace or increase its ranks. The function performed by that cell population decreases. 

It's true for most of your body systems. With age, you have less and less stem cells. You can't renew your bones, your glands producing the hormones regulating you body functions and growth dynamics, your kidneys that, your muscles, your skin, etc... This is what getting old is, your organs being not as well regenerated and progressively losing their ability to assume their functions.

You asked about specific systems. To try and provide a more on point answer, I'd like to mention that perception organs such as light and sound receptors are especially poorly able to regenerate because they are back by only little (or none at all?)

askscience,"First, I'll quote an [old comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/o7c7jp/how_does_running_liquid_through_the_compressor_in/) I made that explains how the vapour compression refrigeration cycle works:

&gt;In a vapour compression refrigeration cycle, a compressor first takes in cool, low-pressure refrigerant gas and compresses it, discharging hot, high pressure gas. This goes through a condenser where it is cooled by ambient air, condensing it into a liquid, while pressure remains approximately constant.  
The next step is the key one that many people miss: expansion. The liquid refrigerant is passed through an expander, typically an expansion valve or a capillary tube. As it passes through the expander, it experiences a sudden drop in pressure, which causes the liquid to partially flash into gas. Since this a phase transition involving latent heat, the resulting liquid-gas mixture is cooled to below ambient temperatures. It is this cold mixture that circulates through the evaporator, where it absorbs heat from the surroundings by virtue of being colder. The heat absorbed goes to boiling off the remaining liquid in the mixture, so the temperature across the evaporator remains approximately constant. The refrigerant, now fully gaseous, returns to the compressor, thus completing the cycle.

Next, I'll address a common misconception that the reason why an ideal gas heats up as it is compressed is because its ""heat energy"" is ""getting concentrated"", and conversely when it expands this energy ""becomes diluted"", therefore it cools down. An ideal gas undergoing adiabatic expansion into a vacuum stays at a constant temperature: by definition no heat is exchanged (Q = 0) and since W = PdV and P = 0, no work is done. From the first law of thermodynamics, ΔU = Q + W = 0, so its internal energy remains constant, and consequently so does its temperature (see [this page](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/sm1/Thermalhtml/node66.html) and [this page](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/sm1/Thermalhtml/node54.html) for a more detailed explanation).

askscience,"Most refrigerators work on the principle of a heat pump. They can work with just about any compressible gas, even normal atmospheric air, but Freon is especially efficient as a refrigerant. A heat pump consists of a condensing coil and an evaporating coil. To understand how it works you have to understand the difference between heat and temperature. Temperature describes the average kinetic energy of molecules within a material or system (in the U.S. temperature is often measured in Fahrenheit, but sometime in Celsius or Kelvin.) Heat is the total amount of energy in a substance or system (and is measured in Joules.) An analogy could be made to water flowing through a pipe, the temperature could be said to be like the speed the water is moving, the heat is the total volume of the water that is moving, which depends on the speed and the diameter of the pipe.

  
Let’s say you have a given amount of gas contained in a system, and that gas has an average temperature that is equal to the air temperature outside the system (that’s the ambient air temperature or room temperature.) The gas in the system has a certain amount of heat to begin with. If you take that gas and pump it under pressure, or compress it, into a container within the system (the compression coil), then initially you will have the same amount of heat, but that heat will be more highly concentrated since you have compressed it into a smaller volume, thus raising the temperature of the gas. The compression coil’s temperature will rise at first, but then cool because it is exposed to the ambient air which is at a lower temperature. As the temperature of the condensing coil cools to the ambient air temperature it is losing heat. Now if you release the compressed gas into the evaporating coil, where there is less pressure, the gas expands to a larger volume. As the gas expands into the evaporating coil the temperature of the gas drops because it initially still has the same amount of heat, but that limited amount of heat has been spread over a larger volume of space, thus the temperature in the evaporating coil drops to below ambient room temperature. A heat pump can be used to heat or cool because the condensing coil operates above ambient room temperature, and the evaporating coil operates below ambient room temperature.",Blueeyedgenie69,1635352555

askscience,"There's a difference in work done BY a  system and work done ON  system. If you squish something, it gains energy and you lose it. If something squishes you, you gain energy and something loses it. Gases work the same way. In thermodynamics it's really annoying to conceptualize because they use words like isotropic and adiabatic and quasi-equilibrium, which are not intuitive to understand from things you have felt before. 

But think about two things you have seen before :

1. A bicycle pump. It gets HOT as you squish the air, because you're taking vibrating air molecules and jamming them all together by doing work with your arms. The temperature goes up for two reasons - one, you've concentrated the same kinetic energy into a smaller area (temperature is KE per volume after all) and you've also increased the potential energy (pressure) 
2. A paintball gun air cylinder (air, not CO2) which gets cold as the air expands out of it simply because the kinetic energy per unit volume goes down as the gas expands (temperature), and the expanding air gives up energy (pressure) either by moving some device or just expanding without restriction. 

I used those examples (gases) because they don't have phase transitions and things like saturation points and vapor pressures  that drive refrigeration cycles. The enthalpy of vaporization is huge compared to potential energy changes due to pressure. That's why CO2, propane tanks, and Freon cylinders get SO cold when they expand, because they also take a tremendous amount of energy to vaporize from liquid to gas. Sadly using propane as a refrigerant is dangerous because of the ol' explodey-splode, but it makes a very good one. Canned air is usually n-fluoroethane which is less flammable than things like butane, and it's good because you can get a LOT of volume in of gas out of a small can of liquid. Industrial refrigerants need to be condensable at normal room temperatures, with a high enthalpy of vaporization, and good chemical compatibilities with things like rubber and metal, and critically not explosive or harmful to the ozone layer.",corsec202,1635352080

After reading a bit, I questioned myself multiple times and for my use of porn I can say it could be a problem but it is not currenctly, at least not yet.

A lot of questions come to mind and I don't get a lot about what's is said.

Is it bad because it creates stardards that are too high?

Is it bad because you will start to compare real sex and porn and everything might become less stimulating?

Is it bad because it overstimulate your mind and then shifts libido and sex drive to visual activities?

Why is it really that bad?

Every time I think about this what comes to my mind is that we are genetically programmed to find the best partner for us, that's why we exist (not that is my main goal in life, I talk about this in biological way), so isn't trying to break boundaries and find new and more stimulating stuff natural? So isn't blocking porn that actually is ""wrong""?

If the benefits or not watching porn is to be happier with real sex, real sex might not be as good as it is to begin with, it might be just a point of view.

askscience,"CPUs in general can suffer from manufacturing defects in the factor, and a survey of such defects can allow bits of the CPU to be physically isolated by burning out selected fuses.

An 8-core CPU which turned out to have 3 dead cores could be electronically configured as a 4-core, and sold as a perfectly working example of same. 

Similarly with speed, CPUs are tested against various voltages and speeds and sold at their optimum performance level. Not all CPUs even from the same wafer are capable of the same speeds due to microscopic differences in the physical features of the finished wafer.

Once they're finished manufacture though, the failure of any trace in the CPU is probably going to kill the CPU entirely. It's possible but unlikely that it might survive the loss of e.g. an edge ground wire, but to be honest that's unlikely to fail first.

TL;DR : any damage to a CPU will probably kill it.

askscience,"Our understanding of the brain is far too rudimentary to create such an interface with the requisite nuance and distinction necessary to make it practical. That being said we do have rudimentary brain-computer interfaces today, and can program such interfaces very easily (oftentimes used for research). For example, we can put someone in an fMRI machine and see where activity (actually bloodflow) changes in the brain, and then we can use that signal to affect a change in something else exterior in the brain. 

Similarly we have research involving chips that the brain can communicate with the move robotic arms, I believe the U of Pennsylvania has a big lab dedicated to that.

But we're not even near the point of having a HUD like in a video game, or being able to use a brain chip to articulate a robotic arm with the same finesse as a biological one. 

The underlying philosophical obstacle (which is gigantic) that further complicates our tech-limitations at understanding the brain is understanding consciousness in general. That's a huge nut to crack, and even after we crack it (if ever) there would be the question of teaching a machine to do it, which seems like it will take a long time to get to, again if ever.

Two systems in contact which are at different temperatures will tend to come to an equilibrium. Heat will be exchanged until the temperatures are roughly equal. This means you can take a gas (system 2) with temperature equalized to system 1, compress it to concentrate the energy and raise the temperature, equalize the temperature to system 3, expand it to lower the temperature and again equalize it to system 1.

On the other side of the cycle the gas is condensed/pressurized via a pump, and the result of changing state from gas to liquid is that heat energy is given off to the (outside) environment.

Even though the lowered temperature is a force acting on the water making it take up less volume, other factors are also working on it to make it expand, and those are stronger.

The pupa is what the animal itself (whether it's a moth or a butterfly) is called during metamorphosis. At no point is there a caterpillar ""inside"" the pupa. If anything, it's almost the opposite: the caterpillar turns into a pupa by shedding its skin, so the pupal skin develops inside the skin of the mature caterpillar.

A cocoon is not part of the animal itself; it's a container made from silk that some insects make before they turn into a pupa. Common in moths; rare in butterflies. The pupa forms inside the cocoon.

askscience,"From my understanding, physics been a while tho:

The two happens for exact same reason. 

Heated things expand beacuse the energy they got from heating makes the particles 'wiggle' more aggressively. In liquids and solids this wiggling fights against external pressure and the interior bonds between particles. So when heated they can push each other apart stronger, resulting in expansion.

The key part is that there is an eqillibruim point between how much space they have and how aggressively can they wiggle. If they are closer than that, the wiggling force is strong enough to push against bonds and pressure, making it expand. If they are further apart than that, the bond forces and pressure are stronger, making it 'collapse' (dont know the word sorry). So if you would decrease pressure, they would expand too, colling down in the process, as now they have the same energy to wiggle but more space to do it, reulting in less collisions (which is basically the source of heat)

In case of gases howewer, they can expand to the volume of the container.

After cooking in the heat exchanger, the pressurised refrigerant passes through a restricted valve at the evaporator entrance. This causes the pressure to drop.. this cold refrigerant passes through another heat exchanger where it picks up heat from your food in the fridge.

askscience,"You are thinking as that metal pipeline gets hot, it expands and when it gets cold, it shrinks and that exactly why pipeline have expansion joints.

That will happen with a gas as well if you were keep the pressure constant and heated or cooled the gas. You would have to change volume to keep pressure constant though, so you can see how thermal contraction and expansion still holds true.  

However, as people pointed out we can use pressure to manipulate the temp of the refigerant.  Think of of the individual  molecule and how in a constant volume randomly moving and bumping into each other.  Pushing more gas into that same space restricts the molecule's movement.  That kinetic energy gets converted to heat energy and that is why the compressor gets hot and the gas gets cold.

Release the pressure, the gas will pick up energy and increase its movement.  It will absorb heat energy from the surroundings and that is why we often see frost on metal parts near a leak.",slo1111,1635344037
askscience,"Unfortunately the other answers aren't correct. Unlike finite difference for example, finite element actually does give a closed form function that approximates the solution. In finite elements we assume the solution of a problem has a given functional form within each element. For example a common assumption is that the solution is approximated by a n-th order polynomial in each element. We then glue each element together by make assumptions about how the solution behaves across element. A common assumption is that the solution in continuous across elements, but first derivatives are not. The analysis then finds coefficients of the functions that give the best approximation. 

Obvious, for a simulation with thousands of elements (or more) it's impractical to write the full solution in closed form. But under the hood the computer uses the solution.",UWwolfman,1635343772

Dopamine and epinephrine are structurally similar, and therefore often have partially overlapping binding profiles. Enzymes and receptors bind based on chemical structure, and the shared similarities in the two neurotransmitters then result in cross-signaling between the two chemicals. 

However, it’s important to get out of the block and white thought process of neurotransmitter types as determinant of function. This is a huge presumption and very little is known about neurochemistry at this very early stage.",Niceotropic,1635343410

In a closed system like a refrigerator where Freon does not enter or escape and V and  n are constant, so we can rearrange the equation to look like P = (constants)T. P goes up as T goes up, and P goes down as T goes down. So when the gas has less pressure and expands, the temperature goes down.

askscience,"There's nothing super wrong here, but it definitely glosses over some very important distinctions and mechanisms. The video mentions in passing the existence of two types of crust, specifically [oceanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust) and [continental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust), but doesn't emphasize that the differences in composition and thickness of these two types of crust, along with [isostasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy), is the fundamental reason why there are ""continents"" (in the geographic sense) and ocean basins. In short, continental crust is less dense and thicker than oceanic crust so generally it ""floats"" higher than the thinner and denser oceanic crust. The place where the video kind of mixes things more than it should is that during its tour of ""lost landmasses"", it's mixing those made up of continental crust and those made of oceanic crust and in doing so, obscuring *why* these features are below sea level. Features like Zealandia are made from continental crust, and the majority of it is below sea level largely because the crust is anomalously thin compared to more typical continental crust (e.g., [Mortimer et al., 2016](https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/27/3/abstract/GSATG321A.1.htm)). In this way, Zealandia shares more in common with [passive margins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_margin), which rim parts of many continents. These passive margins are also thinned continental crust (with some transitional crust kind of between oceanic and continental in terms of composition and thickness) that reflect the continental [rifting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift) process. 

Most of the features the video highlights are [large igneous provinces (LIPs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_igneous_province) and [hotspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotspot_%28geology%29) tracks, both which tend to be considered manifestations of [mantle plumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_plume). The material erupted from hotspots (when erupted through oceanic crust) tends to be very similar in composition to oceanic crust, i.e., dense. Oceanic plateaus formed by LIPs (usually representing the the first intense bout of volcanism when a plume first reaches the surface) and seamounts and oceanic islands from hotspot tracks (representing later stages of plume volcanism) tend to represent thicker accumulations compared to run-of-the-mill oceanic crust, and thus again through isostasy have a higher over all elevation than surrounding oceanic crust. The extent to which many of these ever had major subareal exposures is unclear. In detail, many of these features initially have a higher elevation that gradually subsides. This in a large part relates to [thermal subsidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_subsidence), essentially that the slow cooling of erupted material in LIPs or hotspot volcanoes leads to a decrease in elevation. While other processes also come into play, this is a primary reason why hotspot tracks tend to diminish in relief/elevation away from the active vent(s), e.g., the [Hawaiian-Emperor chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian%E2%80%93Emperor_seamount_chain).

Finally, a few of the features the video highlights are [island arcs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_arc) formed above subduction zones, e.g., the Marianas islands. These are essentially building continental crust (or something pretty close to it), but often are not thick enough to be significantly above sea level. In some ways, the most wrong part of the video was in this discussion and the specific implication that Japan simply represented a volcanic island arc, kind of like a mature version of the Marianas. This is really only a small part of the story as the [tectonic history of Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_Japan) is a whole lot more complex, representing [back-arc extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-arc_basin) that rifted a portion of continental crust from Eurasia, a fair amount of accretion of smaller volcanic chains, and a good bit of arc volcanism. 

**In short,** compared to a lot of geology videos on the internet, this is mostly correct, but it leaves out some very important details, primarily the fundamental role that the differences between oceanic and continental crust and isostatic compensation play in controlling the gross elevation of the features discussed. Similarly, the bit at the very beginning about the controls on how much water the Earth has in total is kind of accurate, but is glossing over some important details (e.g., [Robert, 2001](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1064051)).",CrustalTrudger,1635340301

If you ignore this problem, objects which go too fast won't bounce off other objects. Or sometimes they will, but way too fast, because they first get moved back out of the object they intersected with and that can be seen as having a huge acceleration away from the other object.

This kind of issue is the same kind of issue you can face if you decide to go with a numerical solution for your differential equation, except instead of a ball falling through the floor, instead you fail to spot that your turbine blade is going to vibrate to pieces or something.",F0sh,1635335053

The room-temperature, pressurized liquid is sprayed through a small hole into a wider tube. Because of the larger space available, it boils away quickly and becomes a cold gas at lower pressure.    
The cold gas flows through more tubes, where a fan blows air across them. The air gets cool as the gas absorbs the heat and warms back to room temperature.

If one wishes to apply General Relativity to the entire universe (as cosmologists do), then knowledge of the metric-tensor field on all of *M* is essential, but if one only wishes to apply General Relativity to the Solar System (as Einstein did when attempting to account for the precession of Mercury’s perihelion), then it’s enough to know the metric-tensor field on a coordinate patch of *M* just large enough to encompass the Solar System.",LeonardHuang,1635328118

askscience,"It means to solve the metric, g, for all of spacetime. The metric determines how the Pythagorean theorem works in 3 space dimensions and 1 time dimension. From this you can determine the spacetime interval, which is the measure of “distance” in general relativity.

Some solutions to the field equations exist. In the case of an empty universe, you end up with a Lorentzian metric, which is what you would consider to be a flat spacetime. In this case the metric is (assuming the speed of light is 1, unitless):

ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 - dt^2

Observe the negative sign on dt. This implies that there is a zero spacetime interval. This occurs at the speed of light. It can also divide spacetime intervals into positive or negative values. Some conventions reverse the signs. But the implication is that you can divide the intervals into spacelike (positive in our convention) or timeline (negative). Particles that have mass are required to be timelike, and thus travel less than the speed of light. Virtual particles can be space like.

With a point mass without angular momentum or charge, you can get the Schwarzschild metric, which describes black holes (there are more complex versions with angular momentum and charge like the Kerr-Newman metric).

askscience,"&gt;How could Einstein write an equation that he couldn't solve himself?

Well the problem is that the equations are [DIFFERENTIAL equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation), not algebraic equations, where the solution is nor a mere number but (usually) a function. Differential equations are generally much harder to solve than algebraic ones.

So it's much like Schrodinger's Equation (SE), which when solved gives the wave-function.

The solution of the SE depends on the potential energy term in that equation. So for no potential at all you get an infinite sinusoidal wave (the free particle solution) and for a central potential you get the solutions of the hydrogen atom. 

\-

So going back to [Einstein field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations) (EFE) for General relativity it's the same concept.

The [Schwarzschild solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric) for example is an exact solution to the Einstein field equations that describes the gravitational field outside a spherical mass assuming the mass has no charge, no angular momentum (not spinning) and the universal cosmological constant (which is now understood as the energy density of the vacuum) is zero.

Note that the  Schwarzschild solution does **not only deal with black holes**, but ANY spherical mass. Also the solution to the equation is only valid for radius r &gt;Rs (Schwarzschild radius = 2 G\*M/c\^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass and c the speed of light).

For most objects Rs &lt;&lt; Rm (radius of the mass itself). 

For example the Earth has a radius (Rm) of about 6300 km, but the Schwarzschild radius (Rs) of Earth is about 9 mm. The Sun has a radius of \~696,000 km and its Schwarzschild is about 3 km. 

So no trouble at all describing the gravitational field outside the spherical mass.

HOWEVER, when taking Schwarzschild solution, if there is enough mass concentrated in a volume, you get Rs &lt; Rm there is a boundary at Rs (called also the Event Horizon) where the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light in vacuum.

At r &lt;Rs weird things happen, such as the radial coordinate (r) becomes timelike and the time coordinate becomes spacelike.

\-

Now Schwarzschild solution is basically the almost trivial solution (the trivial one being a vacuum with no mass in it) since it assumes a lot of terms are zero.

If we however add charge, cosmological constant, angular momentum or multiple masses, then you get different solutions, much like when you get different wavefunctions for different potentials in Schrodinger's Equation.

In Einsten Equations however what you solve for is a [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor_(general_relativity)), which is basically a tensor that describes the geometric (and other) properties of spacetime.",FM79SG,1635313842

I'm not exactly an expert on numerical relativity but solving the equations even numerically is hard. Partly for the reason you mentioned. The solutions can be chaotic and can be too sensitive to initial conditions. But general relativity also has a bunch of free degrees of freedom which means that mathematically different looking solutions can actually be the same. Disentangling is mathematically subtle and can also make finding numerical solutions difficult. And finally in many cases it is not enough to solve how space-time changes using the field equations. The matter causing gravity is also interacting and moving and as it moves spacetime also changes. A great example is the problem of understanding the collision between two neutron stars and the gravitational waves it generates.

askscience,"&gt;Did Einstein assume that his equations will be solved one day? 

So the thing is the notion of ""solving the equations"" is itself somewhat incorrect. One doesn't solve the equations, one tries to find specific solutions to differential equations that are valid under specific conditions. For example, when we apply Einstein's equations to the Universe as a whole on the largest scales, we get the FLRW (Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker ) metric solution. This solution to the Einstein's equations describes the Universe as a whole and forms the theoretical basis of the Big Bang cosmology and the idea that the Universe is expanding. This is very different from the Schwarzschild solution that describes a stationary, spherically symmetric object. 

So Einstein would have assumed that exact solutions could have been found in a few specific situations and not in most situations. He himself first developed an approximate solution to apply in the context of the solar system but was delighted to find that Schwarzschild found an exact solution that is applicable under the same situation. 



&gt; Also - how can one assume/understand that any such equation is ""true""/correct (for lack of a better word) if it has not been solved yet?

This is where experiments, observations and the scientific method comes in. There was several reasons back in 1915 to be excited when Einstein first wrote down the field equations but they were still unverified hypotheses back at that time. The truth of any solutions would depend on the truth of the equations themselves. In the century several experimental test of general relativity have been done and the theory has passed every experimental test we have thrown at it.

askscience,"Honestly I think you missed the point! Einstein himself solved his field equations of general relativity, and famously used to to show that it they correctly predict the anomalous precession of Mercury’s orbit.

The key bit that you’re missing is that the process of solving a differential equation depends on the boundary conditions. Solving the Einstein Field equations for an empty universe is pretty straightforward, for example. Solving it for a spherically symmetric distribution of mass is a bit harder, but a good undergraduate physics student shouldn’t have too much trouble with it. But if you wanted to, say, solve the equations precisely for the entire Milky Way galaxy, accounting for each of its stars and all of its dust clouds, your boundary conditions become the mass distribution of the whole galaxy. Solve the EFEs with such a condition would be incredibly impossible.

Einstein didn’t just write down these equations and stop there. He solved them in some relatively simple cases, and he and others have since done so for many other cases. Einstein’s [first major publication](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Foundation_of_the_Generalised_Theory_of_Relativity) about general relativity included solutions that matched Mercury’s peculiar orbit, for example. 

No one would’ve put much stuck in a bunch of equations that no one could solve, or even approximate. GR caught on so quickly because of its early successful predictions. But just because we can solve it for some special cases doesn’t mean we can solve it for *any* case.",sticklebat,1635307682

askscience,"It might be easier to talk about the momentum of an object. Normally, momentum is talked about as simply the mass of an object times its velocity (p = mv). It turns out this is only true when the velocity is low. It's actually not m \* v, but it's close enough that it's hard to notice the difference. The actual equation is momentum  = ( m \* v) / sqrt( 1 - (v^(2)/ c^(2)) ). As you can see, we have velocity squared divided by the speed of light squared. If your velocity is low, that bottom part is basically just 1 and you can ignore it, but as your velocity gets really close to c, things get weird.

at 0.9 c, we have 0.81 c\^2 / c\^2 = 0.81. Thus our denominator becomes sqrt(1 - 0.81) or sqrt(0.19) which is 0.436. By dividing by that number, we're saying that the momentum of an object going at 0.9 c is actually a lot higher than what we'd expect if momentum was just m \* v.

Mass^(A) / Velocity^(B) = Gravity^(C)

&amp;#x200B;

That's an example, not a real equation, don't worry.

Basically, he might take the masses of 100 known stars and their velocities and estimated Gravitational influences, plot that out on a chart, and then deliver the equation to suggest that ""all stars in this table fall along a curve when plotted, my equation predicts that when we have the means to measure stars outside the parameters this chart includes, we will find xyz because my equation accounts for everything within the chart, and there is no reason to think it can't also include items not yet charted"".

And then people would spend time trying to prove him right or wrong by throwing proverbial spaghetti (made up numbers) to see what predictions they could discover for this or that spot in the chart which were not yet filled-- and then trying out observational hunts to see if they could find objects in the universe which would prove or disprove the prediction that the curve predicted by his equations would extend beyond the chart, or whether the curve had to flow some other direction once it left the chart (suggesting he was lacking in information).

Again, that's only analogy, the reality is way more complicated.

(And, so far, his equations seem to hold up for anything bigger than an atom and less dense than a black hole, but outside of those parameters and his predictions fall apart-- so he was right so far for things at the 'human' scale, but not outside of that).",kmoonster,1635302384

askscience,"&gt;Shouldn't the inter-atomic forces that make a higher melting point also make a higher boiling point?

No; if the liquid phase is particularly stable (i.e., if it has a relatively low [Gibbs free energy G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_free_energy), then the melting point will be low and the boiling point high. It may be useful to review a [key image for phase equilibrium and transitions](https://i.stack.imgur.com/euYPI.gif). Nature moves to minimize G, and so the phase with the lowest G is the equilibrium stable phase. By definition, G = H - TS, where H is the enthalpy, T is the temperature, and S is the entropy, so the curves are flat (and equal the enthalpy) at T = 0 and then decrease with slope S with increasing T.

In contrast, note that some materials *don't* have a particularly stable liquid phase, and so this phase never dips below the solid and gas phases on the G vs. T chart. An example is carbon dioxide, which sublimates directly from solid to gas with increasing temperature.",Chemomechanics,1635300169

And a system with zero net electric charge can still produce a nonzero electric field, like ideal electric dipoles, quadrupoles, etc. (Remember that the neutron is made of quarks, and even though its electric monopole moment vanishes, it may have a very small electric dipole moment, and certainly has a small electric quadrupole moment.)

Basically the opposite of what you suggest, it's a rocket that supplements the onboard oxidizer with air.  But the general concept of ""combined-cycle engines"" is the phrase you're looking for.  There are several combinations of rockets, gas-turbines, and ram/scramjets that are put together to try and solve the problem your asking about (look up the National Aero-Space Plane, [NASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_X-30)).

Directly, gas-turbine engines would never really benefit from onboard oxidizer.  What you suggest is certainly possible, but the system would be ineffective for any meaningful duration.  A normal rocket would be better.

For aircraft at high altitude, transitioning to ramjet or scramjet engines makes it possible to obtain enough air to sustain combustion.  Effectively, they just go so fast that they can capture enough air.  The speed also makes it so they can aerodynamically compress the air and don't need any turbomachinery.  However, ramjets and scramjets need a rocket or gas-turbine to get the vehicle up to operating speeds (see [X-43](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_X-43), [X-51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-51_Waverider), and some much more recent tests)

The problem with carbon is bringing in carbon from sources outside the ecosystem. Digging up coal, oil or gas and burning them release HUGE amounts of CO2 that didn’t come from a plant (in the last few million years), and there aren’t an equivalent amount of extra plants to take that carbon dioxide in.

Worse, as we continue to chop forests down, we are reducing the amount of plant life able to take in the excess carbon.

The Navier-Stokes equations have been solved for many situations, like any hydrostatic situation, or various channel and pipe flows (Couette, Poiseuille, etc.). If you're referring to the Millenium Problem, it's about proving or disproving that a solution exists and is smooth for **any** given initial condition.

The NSE is just a statement of conservation of momentum in fluid flows, so as long as you include all the relevant forces, it's correct (unless of course momentum isn't conserved).

askscience,"I think because of a few things, one of them being how often a function is used (why we would think of allowing it or not in the first place) and how quickly we can get it to converge:

sin(x) needs only 6 or 7 terms when expanded before looking practically identical to the actual answer. 

The solution to the 3 body problem (which has a super bad, but correct, solution) takes AGES to converge, and importantly, it's chaotic. That is:

Repeating sin(sin(sin(...(x)...))) For two very similar x values will give 2 very similar answers for all values of x and for any number of iterations, including at the limit at infinity (where the answer would just be a flat line f(x) = 0)

Repeating a function like f(x) = x^(2)-1 (or the 3bodyproblem) over and over (which I forgot to mention is the equivalent to stepping through time by 1 second and then using these values to get another set of values, aka using the function for a bunch of stuff) would instead give rise to a mess, with similar values giving wildly different answers. 

Another way to phrase this is that the sine function when interated either has no cycles, or has ""attractive cycles"" (ie. Numbers near cycling numbers will also begin to cycle) while x^(2)-1 (and the 3 body problem) has repelling cycles, where numbers close together will end up wildly apart.

So, Newton basically took a guess and wrote down an equation for how temperature changes over time. The rate, *dT(t)/dt*, is proportional to how far the current temperature is from ambient, *T(t) - T\_0*. So his equation looked like this:

    dT(t)/dt = -c*(T(t) - T_0)

askscience,"Enh... you're mixing incompatible theories here. And there's a misconception or two mixed in. 

First: the creation of an event horizon isn't really about compressing particles. Its more like ""this much information cannot exist in this small of a space"". In a literal sense, X information cannot fit inside space with dimensions y,z. But there are real physical processes out there, consequences of the behavior of gravity, which DO manage to pull that off. And when that happens, a horizon is formed. The term is ""Bekenstein Boundary"" or sometimes ""Bekenstein Limit"". The name is for the gent who figured it out.. and it translates mathematically to ""this much space can only hold just so much stuff"", and the stuff in question is entropy. 

When a sufficiently large star dies through supernova, the core is momentarily compressed FAR, FAR beyond the Bekenstein Limit for how much entropy is present. Gravity becomes the dominant force, and an event horizon is formed. But really, what a horizon is in this case is describable as a ""surface of last scattering"". And what happens is that over staggeringly unimaginable long time frames, all that entropy (and all the entropy that ever falls in past the horizon... although that's not an entirely accurate way to describe it either) eventually *falls back out* via Hawking Radiation. Its much more accurate and reasonable, in fact, to talk about all that entropy being temporarily trapped on the horizon than ever actually being inside it. Over timescales we can't properly describe in human terms, everything *scatters* off the horizon. 

Second: hypotheticals about massive particles with zero radius are mostly just silly. Electrons, for example, have such a vanishingly small mass that the event horizon one might produce is smaller than we can realistically describe. And I don't mean we don't have the ability to work out numbers that small... we do. I simply mean that below a certain length (the Planck Length, to be specific) *nothing really means anything any more*. The Planck Length is, very likely, the minimum pixel depth for the cosmos in every meaningful way.

So for the OP, the final point is that we solve the same differential equation, relating curvature and energy-density, for many different kinds of energy-densities. The energy-density near Earth is quite different from the energy-density near a stationary, uncharged blackhole, which is quite different from the energy-density near the incredibly hot plasma in the core of a star like our Sun. (And sometimes we do the reverse: given a target sort of curvature we want, what sort of energy-density is required to make that curvature? This is how the [study of warp drives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06824) usually works.) 

So, for OP, the differential equations are a law of physics, but for each real-world scenario you need to deduce the implications of that law -- solve the differential equation -- differently for each scenario.

askscience,"&gt; The equations I see are complicated but they seem to boil down to basic algebra. Once you have the equation, wouldn't you just solve for X?

I want to give you a mathematician's perspective of this, rather than a physicist one.  Solve can mean to find a specific solution, or a general formula, or a closed-form solution.  You may be familiar with the quadratic equation: solving ax^2 + bx + c = 0 results in x = [-b +/- sqrt(b^2-4ac)]/2a.  General solutions for the cubic (3rd power) and quartic (4th power) equations were found subsequently.

Mathematicians struggled to get a general solution for quintic (5th powers).  Were we not trying hard enough to punch through the basic algebra?  No.  An amazing result by Abel and Ruffini at the turn of the 18th century showed that **there is no general formula for solving the quintic using radicals**. 

Our ability to solve equations (especially for closed-form solutions) are limited by the toolkit we have for solving them.  Learning algebra in grade school is one such toolkit. If you go beyond that, you'll find we can write down plenty of equations which we have no closed-form solutions for, most integrals and differential equations have no nice closed-form solutions.  There's the famous $1m Navier-Stokes equation, which can be stated in a few lines of dense math.

Is all this talk about closed-form solutions too abstract for you? How about just numbers? Can mathematicians find numbers to plug in that satisfy this equation?

Turns out, even simple looking problems can be fiendish.  Take a look at this one on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-find-the-positive-integer-solutions-to-frac-x-y+z-+-frac-y-z+x-+-frac-z-x+y-4).  The tools you need to solve that go way beyond what an average person, or even an average math undergrad would be familiar with.

So maybe we need better tools.  Is there a limit to this?  In the context of **finding integer numbers that can be plugged into multivariate polynomial equations to make them true**, this is what David Hilbert asked as his 10th problem on his famous list of problems published in 1900.  Is there a universal ""algorithm"" that solves these?  Naturally you would think either we have one, or we haven't tried hard enough.  Surprisingly, the answer is **no, and there will never be**.  The proof of this refutation goes into computability theory and how Turing Machines work.",DoWhile,1635285074

askscience,"This question has already received a lot of excellent answers, so I'd like to add only one thing which others did mention but not in  way that is - I think - emphasized or immediately parsable to a general audience.

It is probably best to think off differential equations not as algebraic equations like quadratic equations which you can solve and get a definite answer once and for all (although a quadratic equation in one variable has two solutions most of the time!), but rather as a machine that takes some data as input and gives other data as an output.

For example if we look at (classical) particle mechanics rather than field mechanics, Newton's equation is **F**(**x**,**v**,t)=m**a**, where **F** is a known function of the position, the velocity and time, and we have **v**(t)=d**x**/dt and **a**(t)=d**v**/dt, this is a second order ordinary differential equation, which means that *once an initial time* t_0, *an initial position* **x**_0 and an initial velocity **v**_0 is given, it spits out a *unique* function **x**(t), which describes the motion of the particle.

Of course the process of ""spitting out"" involves solving the differential equation, which is very very difficult (most of the time anyways). Which means that differential equations do not model ""static"" situations but ""dynamical"" situations. They take some environment as input data and spit out the response to that data.

This means that when Einstein formulate the Einstein Field Equations (EFE), he basically gave the law of gravitation. He formulated in mathematical terms how the gravitational field and matter interacts. How matter generates gravity, how that gravity propagates in spacetime and how matter moves under the influence of gravity. The EFE contain all this information, and one can get a very large amount of ""qualitative"" data from them even without solving them explicitly. For example, if we put ""physically reasonable"" constraints on the energy-momentum tensor (the quantity that appears on one side of the EFE that contains information about matter), then we can derive from the EFE that gravitation is attractive! (in that bodies drift towards one another under their mutual gravity)

In order to understand general relativity, we do not need to solve the EFE explicitly, but I also mean to emphasize that we didn't solve the EFE *generally* at all.

In differential equations lingo, a ""general solution"" is a solution of the equation that also contains the ""data"" required to solve the equation uniquely. If you know the general solution and you have some eg. initial data which you want to use as input data, you can literally just plug in the initial data and you'll get the explicit solution for that data.

The EFE is basically impossible - in practical terms - to be given a general solution. Stuff like the Schwarzschild solution are very special solutions that are heavily constrained by very restrictive symmetry considerations. Only these sort of solutions we have for the EFE.",Ulrich_de_Vries,1635284925
askscience,"That's correct. A differential equation describes a ""family"" of functions, and any function that satisfies the equation is a valid solution to that equation. Many physical laws are described in this way. For example the equation for ballistic trajectories can be solved by any parabola that a ball could go through if thrown, but a triangular shape would not, and therefore is not a physically possible trajectory for a thrown ball.

Once you have a *particular* function that solves the equation, you can plot the entire course of the ball by plugging in concrete values for the inputs to the function (in this case, the time).

So what Swarzschild did was describe the configuration of gravity around a black hole in a way that satisfies Einstein's differential equations. You could also solve the same equations for, say, a GPS satellite in orbit around a planet, which is in fact necessary so that GPS coordinates can be accurately calculated.",Noiprox,1635284858

I want to point out here that this is basically what every videogame is doing all the time. If the game has any sort of simulated physics—even basic gravity in a 2D side-scroller—then there is code in there calculating the positions of everything.

If you melt the lard and mix it with equal amounts of olive oil you'll get a substance with a melting point about halfway inbetween, near room temperature. It will be a liquid in your hands and a solid in the fridge.

askscience,"The origin of mid-ocean ridge segmentation has been a long-standing puzzle with a few different explanations posed. The standard view for quite a while was that it related to underlying segmentation of small scale mantle flow features and localization of productive melt lenses (e.g., [Schouten et al., 1985](https://www.nature.com/articles/317225a0), [Macdonald et al., 1988](https://www.nature.com/articles/335217a0), [Macdonald et al., 1991](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17775341/)). Basically that ridge segments overlie productive melt lenses which don't line up perfectly with each other and transforms represent structures passively formed to accommodate the resulting differential motion created at the surface. This model works reasonably well, but it's never been able to fit with all observations and there have been a variety of alternatives suggested, at least for particular segments, e.g., that transforms could form through changes in plate motion direction (e.g., [Lonsdale, 1989](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JB094iB09p12197)).

More recently, it has been suggested that the ultimate cause of ridge segmentation (and the formation of transforms) is a tendency for the direction of upper mantle motion to be slightly skewed with respect to plate motion (e.g., [Toomey et al., 2007](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05679)). This skew in turn causes a shear on the ridge axis essentially ""breaking"" the ridge axis and forming transforms and with the observed details of alignment of melt productivity with ridge segments (i.e. the references in the beginning) being a consequence of the geometry of the ridge axes, not a cause of the ridge geometry (e.g., [VanderBeek et al., 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2745)). This explanation would also be in line with observations from ultra-slow spreading ridges, which generally tend to have very few transforms (e.g., [Michael et al., 2003](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01704)) but also tend to have spreading directions oblique to the ridge orientation (e.g., [Dick et al., 2003](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02128/)).",CrustalTrudger,1635277781

askscience,"If I just write down a differential equation like df/dx = kf, I can solve it by separation of variables:

df/f = k dx

ln(f) = kx + C

f(x) = exp[kx + C].

But this is ambiguous, because there's an arbitrary constant of integration, C.

I don't want some arbitrary constant in my answer, I want to actually plug things into my function f and use its numerical values.

So the equation above isn't enough, I also need a boundary condition (or initial condition if you're thinking of the independent variable as time).

So if I instead restart and use both an equation and a boundary condition, for example:

df/dx = kx, f(0) = 1,

I can do the same thing and solve the equation using separation of variables:

f(x) = exp[kx + C],

and now require that f(0) = 1:

f(0) = exp[C] = 1, or C = ln(1) = 0.

So in this case, C happens to be zero, and the final answer is f(x) = exp[kx].

Now there's no more arbitrary constant, and I can actually calculate numbers specific to the case I'm interested in.

If instead of a first-order ODE, I had written down a higher-order ODE, I would have needed more boundary/initial conditions to fully specify the solution. And in the case of a PDE, your boundary conditions can be entire functions.",RobusEtCeleritas,1635277416

As others have said, this is made more complicated by the fact that the solution to a differential equation is itself an equation. For a given scenario, you solve the Einstein field equations to get equations that describe the behavior of that scenario. However, those solutions will be different in a different scenario.

askscience,"I don't know Einstein's equations well specifically, but I've done things like this with the Navier-Stokes equations that describe fluid flow. On a conceptual level, the basic idea with these systems of equations is that they don't describe any specific situation by themselves, but instead they are a literal, mathematical description of how a system of rules governs things according to a specific theory. To ""solve"" them by themselves has no meaning.

What you are meant to do is take these equations and combine them with some more equations that you write yourself which describe a specific situation in the physical world. If you're using Navier-Stokes for example, you might write some equations that describe a round pipe of specific size with a specific fluid flowing through it at a specific rate. Combine those 2 sets of equations together and you can do some algebraic combinations and simplifications (which would be referred to as ""solving"") and get out the other side equations describing various other things, like in this case the actual fluid flow velocity at a specific place in the pipe as a function of the distance from the center of the pipe.

In the case of Einstein's equations, I might be off a bit, but as I understand, you might take those and combine them with for example some equations describing a perfect spherical planet of specific size and uniform density, and get out a set of equations describing the curvature/structure of spacetime at any specific point as a function of the position relative to that planet.",CountingMyDick,1635274090

askscience,"First, it is true that given an equation, one can try some numerical approximation to find an approximate answer.

For the equation x2-2=0, the numerical approximation will be 1.414... However, the precise answer is ""the square root of 2"". More generally, second order equations are always easily solvable. But that's an easy case. As a more difficult case, 5th order equations (like x5-x-r=0) are not all solvable, for example. Numerical approximations are always possible, but you won't have a nice formula for them.

But in the case of field equations, Steven worst, as you're not searching for a single number, but for a function. That's like trying to compute the full trajectory of a projectile. In this case, numerical approximation are much more difficult, as if you make a small approximation at the beginning of the trajectory, it can have huge consequences on the final position of the projectile. In some simple cases (like projectile going through empty void), there are some very clever methods to find an exact answer for the trajectory. 

But most of the time, scientists are forced to use an hybrid of numerical approximation and exact solution: they make some approximations in the equations to make them simpler, and then they give an exact solution to this approximated equation. That's what's often made for computing the actual trajectory of projectiles, one have to approximate ""how the air and wind behave around the projectile"" to get any actual results.

And that's basically where we are with those field equations. They are order of magnitude more complex than other equations that we don't even know how to solve. Even giving approximate solutions more accurate than the ones we have would be a huge milestone.

askscience,"&gt;What does it mean to “solve” Einstein's field equations?

It means to find a function (or family of functions) which satisfies the relationship given by the EFEs between that function and its partial derivatives/antiderivatives.

&gt;How could Einstein write an equation that he couldn't solve himself?

In short:  because hard math is really hard.  Even simple, single-variable polynomial equations (like x^(3) + 2x^(2) - 5x + 7 = 0) only have exact solutions when the highest term is x^(4) or less.  It can be [proven mathematically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini_theorem) that as soon as you have a power of x higher than 4, there is no longer any guarantee that it can be solved exactly at all, and in fact [almost all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_all) polynomials of degree 5 or higher have no exact solution even in principle.

Now, even that's just talking about *single*-variable *polynomial* equations.  But that's not what the EFEs are.  The EFEs are *partial differential* equations, which are a very different beast from polynomial equations.

&gt;The equations I see are complicated but they seem to boil down to basic algebra. Once you have the equation, wouldn't you just solve for X?

&gt;I'm guessing the source of my confusion is related to scientific terms having a different meaning than their regular English equivalent. Like how scientific ""theory"" means something different than a ""theory"" in English literature.

Actually it sounds to me like the source of your confusion is simply not knowing what a differential equation is, let alone a *partial* differential equation.  Maybe I can help you to understand by giving a comparison here.

First, let us ask:  what does it mean for a polynomial equation to even be solved?  It means that we can reduce all of its variables (whether one or many) into a simple numeric expression, such as:  x=2.  Having a solved equation like this is very powerful, because it means we can plug a number into any other equation featuring the variable x and we can get out another number.  But more complicated polynomial equations such as x^(2) - 4x^(2) + 4 = 0 do not have this nice and simple ""solved"" form, where we know what the value of x is.  So, we have to use algebraic techniques (like factoring) in order to reduce it into this simple ""solved"" form that is useful.  This is especially difficult when we have multiple distinct variables (like x^(2) + 3xy - 5y^(2) + 10 = 0).

Put another way:  a *polynomial* equation is a mathematical relationship between one or more *variables* and arbitrary *powers of those variables*, which can then be manipulated in order to determine what the *value of those variables* are.

Now, in the above paragraph, replace the following words:

* polynomial → differential
* variables → functions
* powers of those variables → derivatives of those functions
* value of those variables → algebraic forms of those functions

So, a *differential* equation is a mathematical relationship between one or more *functions* and arbitrary *derivatives of those functions*, which can then be manipulated in order to determine what the *algebraic forms of those functions* are.

As you can probably guess, this is a pretty *huge* leap in complexity from simple polynomial equations.  You're no longer just solving to get the numeric values of variables (like x=2, y=3), you're solving to get the algebraic form of *entire functions* (like f(x) = e^(x) + C, g(x) = 2xdx + C).

And just like there are different kinds of polynomial equations with different levels of complexity (single-variable vs. multi-variable, binomial vs. trinomial vs. higher-polynomial), there are also different kinds of differential equations with different complexities.  An *ordinary* differential equation, for example, involves only derivatives of one or more independent, *single*-variable functions.  A *partial* differential equation on the other hand involves partial derivatives of one or more independent *multi*-variable functions.

Now consider further that the Einstein field equation is also a [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor) equation with 10 distinct components.  A tensor is a generalization of the concepts of scalars and vectors but to higher dimensions (so, a scalar is a rank-0 tensor, a vector is a rank-1 tensor, and the word ""tensor"" is often reserved for rank-2 or higher tensors).  You can write down the components of a tensor in a matrix form, just like you can write down the components of a vector in matrix form (for example, v = [ v_x, v_y, v_z]).  Doing so, you now have a full 4x4 square matrix, which has 16 total components.  In relativity however, this matrix is required to be symmetric, so only 10 of those components are unique (the other 6 are just copies of the 6 off-diagonal components).

So, your confusion comes from the fact that you're comparing an extremely complicated partial differential tensor equation involving functions of multiple variables to a vastly simpler polynomial scalar equation of a single variable.  If you would have trouble solving even a degree-five polynomial equation of a single scalar variable, how much more difficult then do you suppose it is to solve partial differential tensor equations?  :P

TL;DR:  Math can be really *really* hard, and Einstein was playing with some of the most challenging math that existed at the time.  It's so challenging that there is a reason why we don't even introduce the concepts involved at a high-school level.  It's the same reason why you don't teach calculus to a 5-year-old.  That's the kind of major genius that Einstein and his contemporaries possessed.

askscience,"I'd like to supplement what RobusEtCeleritas said with a more conceptual explanation of what ""solving a differential equation"" means, as I find the phrase rather unintuitive, even if it is technically accurate.

A differential equation explains how some quantity (represented by a variable) changes *as a function of its current value*. Mathematically, this means an equation which includes both a function and at least one of its derivatives (the ""rate of change"" of the function). The equation describes how the quantity changes with respect to some other quantity, usually time or space. (The Schrödinger Equation, another notorious differential equation, describes how a quantum-mechanical wave changes across space in a single instant in time or through time at a single point in space.)

""Solving"" a differential equation means getting rid of the derivative term (the rate of change) so that you can calculate the state of the system at any point in time, space, or whatever without knowing the previous value of the system. For example, we know that a mass oscillating on a string is at any given moment accelerating according to the equation `ma=-kx`, where the acceleration *a* is the *second derivative* of the location in space, *x*; *m* is the mass of the object and *k* is a constant that relates the displacement of the object from its equilibrium position to the force that it feels from the string. x and a are both functions of time, but you can't use this equation to figure out what x will be after a certain amount of time.

If you want to know x at any time, you can do one of two things: First, you can give a computer an initial value for *x* and tell it to step forward through many time steps, recalculating the acceleration, velocity, and position of your mass-and-spring system at each iteration - this is called solving the equation *numerically*. The benefit is that it works for literally any equation if you have enough computing power - but sometimes that's a big *if*. The second method is to find what's called an *analytical solution*, i.e. an equation that describes the state of the system at any point in time. For our example, that equation is `x=A*sin(w*t + p)`*,* where A, w, and p are constants describing the amplitude, frequency, and initial phase of the oscillations (very intuitive, useful concepts), and t is the point in time. If you can calculate sine, you can calculate the state of this system at literally any point in time (at least in physics-land, where the universe consists of only this one idealized, eternal spring contraption). Here we see the advantage over the numerical approach: If your spring oscillates several hundred times per second and you want to know where it will be after a billion seconds, you would need to calculate *thousands of billions* of time steps to get a possibly wildly incorrect answer via the numerical approach. With an analytical solution, just plug in 1,000,000,000 for *t* and calculate the answer to whatever arbitrary level of precision you want.

You may be wondering how we went from the linear equation for acceleration to a sine wave. These seem like fundamentally different functions, and it's not at all clear how one emerges from the other. And this was just about the most simple example possible - so that should give you some idea of what a monumental task it is to solve the equations of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics even for very simple, idealized cases.",newappeal,1635273099

askscience,"Just to add a bit more detail on why solving a differential equation is hard. A differential equation takes the state of an object or a system at one time and/or location and tells you its state at another time and/or location. For example suppose you throw a ball up, you can use Newton's laws to set up a differential equation that tells you the speed and the position of the ball at every point in time. To solve this equation you need information about the state of the system called initial conditions. For example the speed and the position of the ball - i.e the solutions to the differential equation - will depend crucially on how fast you throw it; for slower speeds the ball will fall back but at high enough speeds it will leave the earth (basically a rocket). 

The above example is actually a fairly simple differential equation. For a more complicated case suppose you want to model a hurricane and predict if and when it will hit your city and at what speed. You will use the framework of Navier-Stokes equations to model it. But this depends not only on initial - the position and speed of the hurricane now - but also what are called boundary conditions. For example it matters for hurricane evolution if it is on land or water. Navier-Stokes equations are exceedingly difficult to solve exactly under most boundary conditions and usually people use sophisticated computer algorithms to come up with approximate but good solutions to the equations. 

Similarly, the Einstein's field equations provide a complicated framework for setting up differential equations to understand gravity and space and time. These equations can in principle describe the evolution of any kind of spacetime but solving them for arbitrary initial and boundary conditions is very hard. Schwarzschild's solution is a special solution where a static solution - i.e not changing with time - if found assuming spherically symmetric boundary conditions. There are a bunch of other cases where similar exact solutions to the equations can be found, but in many cases we again resort to using computer algorithms to solve the equations in an approximate manner.",elenasto,1635272492
askscience,"&gt;which is the limit a body of mass can be squished to if you were to remove all space between particles.

That's not what the Schwarzschild radius represents. It's not a limit of the ability of a material to be compressed, it's simply the radius in which a certain amount of mass needs to be compressed in order for an event horizon to form. It doesn't actually depend on any of the material properties of the object, only on the total mass.

&gt;But the part you added at the end.. does that mean that his solution to the equations would suggest that the entire universe is inside a non-spinning black hole? Or is his solution just what amount of mass is absolutely needed to form a black hole?

The Schwarzschild solution represents an infinite universe in which there is nothing but a single black hole. That's not what *our* universe looks like, but it's a valid solution to the equations which appear to govern gravity (at least classically).",RobusEtCeleritas,1635272424

So each equation in a set of equations can be quite simple, while creating a set of constraints which may or may not have a solution. And it may be complex enough that you can't even tell whether there is a solution or not, let alone what that solution is .

So Einstein created a set of equations that are supposed to describe various truths about the universe. Each equation is its own truth. Given that we only have one universe, presumably if all the equations are correct there exists some set of values such that all of the equations are complete, correct, and have known values or relationships that work everywhere. 

Now if you've ever done simultaneous equations you know that you can substitute parts of one equation into another equation as long as you can find equivalences to those sections. Y=X^2, Z=X^2+Y has X^2 in both so the second can be rewritten as Z=Y+Y or Z=2Y. And here I've made some progress, but because I have fewer equations that I have variables, I never got to an actual answer.

So as you solve simultaneous equations you may be making things simpler, or you could weigh be making things way more complex. You can actually make things so complex that they can't really be simplified without breaking your own brain .

So solving a series of equations that work together such as Einstein's equations can be an incredibly non-trivial problem even if all the equations involved are themselves both demonstrably true and easy to understand.",BitOBear,1635271752

askscience,"&gt; Just curious how a car like the Prius that is powered partly by gas and partly by battery

Most Priuses are entirely powered by gas, although the old plug-in Prius and the newer Prius Prime get some of their power from charging a small battery from the electrical supply.

A normal non-plug-in Prius does have a battery and two electric motor-generators, but all of the power for those comes from gasoline, either by directly running the engine to turn the motor-generators to make power, or by using the motor-generators to slow the car down, converting kinetic energy to electric.  

But in general, the battery in a hybrid is there to reduce losses.  The maximum efficiency is still set by the engine-- but a normal car will have a total efficiency that is worse than the efficiency of its engine, because it loses energy to braking and to running the engine at less efficient speeds out of necessity for driving (or idling).  The hybrid can keep the engine at its most efficient operating points (or off, instead of idle) and gets some of the energy lost to braking back.  But the power all comes from the gas engine, and everything else is just ways to reduce how much of that is lost.",raygundan,1635271670

askscience,"&gt;How could Einstein write an equation that he couldn't solve himself? 

It's very easy to write down a differential equation (less so to radically rethink what space and time are, and come up with a totally new equation governing them, but that's immaterial), but it's not generally easy to *solve* differential equations. Especially solving 16 coupled and nonlinear partial differential equations, which is what the EFE really are.

&gt;The equations I see are complicated but they seem to boil down to basic algebra. Once you have the equation, wouldn't you just solve for X?

These are not algebraic equations, they're differential equations. But even if it was just algebra, there are still equations which can't be ""solved for x"". For example, x + sin(x) = 0, try to solve that for x.

With a differential equation, you're not just solving for a number, you're solving for a function. Something like:

df/dx + f^(2) + sqrt(f) = 0.

This is a first-order, nonlinear, ordinary differential equation for the function f(x).

&gt;Does ""solving an equation"" mean something different than it seems?

No, it really is just solving an equation (technically 16 of them). But they're differential equations, and they're being solved for functions. Those functions are the components of the metric tensor, which encodes the structure of spacetime. The Schwarzschild solution is one particular example, where the spacetime consists of a single uncharged, non-rotating black hole.",RobusEtCeleritas,1635269486

From what I could find online, the maximum depth is 695 feet below the 901 foot maximum surface elevation, implying the deepest point is at an elevation of 206 feet.

Also to be fair, the lake isn't a giant swimming pool with vertical walls.  It gets narrower as it gets deeper, and large sections dry up completely as the water level drops.  Starting the chart at the ""true"" bottom of 205 feet would still be very misleading.

One news article I found indicated that at 655 feet, the lake is only at 27% of capacity.  Starting the chart at 0 feet would falsely imply that 655 feet is at 73% capacity.  Starting at the ""true"" bottom of 206 feet would imply that 655 feet is 65% full.  Starting the chart around 560 feet would more accurately reflect how low 655 feet is, in terms of capacity.  They rounded up to 600 feet.  It's a bit disingenuous, but not nearly as much as you're implying.  Honestly, they could have started the chart at a nice round 500 feet, which pegs 655 feet at about 39% visually, and it would be a much better representation (at least for current conditions), visually implying the lake has more water than it really does, compensating for the misleading depth.

It's all academic anyway, because if you play around with the chart, you'd realize that it automatically scales the vertical axis to show the available data (much like the charts in Excel).  In which case, it wasn't even a conscious decision to mislead, just an artifact of the data.

It works the opposite way too when source is moving towards you each next wave peak will be slightly closer to the previous than if the source was stationary.

Red and blue shifts don't affect ordering of events. Just simple fact that light speed isn't infinite is enough to mess it for different observers. It's like playing a shooter game on a server with high latency. There are always disagreements when projectile connects as target dodges. You just can't achieve a consistent picture.

The only thing that everyone agrees on are casual connections. Did target dodged a projectile after he knew it was fired? Did you fired a projectile after you saw him dodge?

Mathematically this is represented by spacetime interval. It's just a number, a measurable quantity of causality. When it's *""negative""* events are casually disconnected.

Storms there are heavily front loaded, so you’ll see the most risk of flooding during an event, especially towards the first half to 1/3 of the storm. 

California’s droughts have little to do with the lack of trapping the water. Water will naturally find it’s way to the ocean given enough volume/time. The problem is overpopulation. The LA area specifically has had to import the majority of its water from places like the Owen’s River Valley for many many years. LA as a city shouldn’t exist, quite frankly. It’s supposed to be a literal desert, not the green paradise it’s made their image out to be. Drive outside the city for a bit and you’ll see what the area should naturally look like (spoiler alert, it’s a bunch of desert shrubs).

Consider two climates where the average daily temperature is 70F.  Nice places, yes?   In one the low temp is 65 and the high is 75, so the diurnal variation in this temperate zone is pleasant.  In the other, a desert zone, the low is 40 and the high is 100 because there are now clouds to hold in the heat.  It radiates away at night and the sun beats down during the day.   Get the idea?

Now consider this regarding rainfall.  There are places like Britain where most every day has a little bit of rain or drizzle somewhere, and more during storms.  Dry spells are rare.  Thus the average rainfall is pretty even month to month, and year to year.   

 In areas like the southwestern US, the average rainfall over a decade reflects 7 years of drought, 2 years of moderate rainfall, and one year of huge floods, give or take.    So headlines like ""Drought Continues for 3rd Year"" and ""Record Flooding Over Region"" are normal parts of this cycle.

And that's just the way it is.",atomicsnarl,1635258800

askscience,"&gt;You don't always even have symbols when you have a modulating signal

You do in digital modulation. In most digital modulation types each symbol represents more than one bit. QAM64, for example, has 6 bits per symbol. A 6 MHZ DTV channel using QAM64 has a bit rate of over 30Mbps.  

OFDM can have hundreds of subcarriers each with multiple bits per symbol. The advantage there is that the relatively low symbol rate is more resistant to multipath distortion.",Diligent_Nature,1635258654
askscience,"Great answer.  In short, high rainfall usually involves much more surface runoff than infiltration (infiltration is slow relative to runoff).  In areas with large surface water bodies (lakes/ponds/reservoirs) with low water levels, the runoff gets mostly captured for future use, so is generally good for areas that rely on reservoirs etc.  The larger problem of dry soil and deeper groundwater levels takes longer to recover.  Having higher water levels in storage does allow irrigation to transfer water across the region at a more useful rate, so if the reservoir levels can be sustained, the drought problem can be largely ameliorated.

For California, developing a deep snowpack is huge. Melting is a slow process so water release is over long time periods, as a general thing.",Busterwasmycat,1635258622

askscience,"A couple things:

1. Runoff from urban areas (which is most of what fills the LA River) isn't worth storing because of the amount of processing required to make it usable, even for agricultural use.
2. California's reservoir system was (mostly) built with a focus on hydroelectric power generation, not water supply.  Low attitude basisns (like LA) are useless for that.  The only exceptions to this I'm aware of are in the Santa Cruz Mountains, mostly in the SF Bay Area where there are some flood prevention reservoirs (Steven's Canyon, Lexington).

Let's say your spacecraft has a mass of 5 tons. That means you require approx. 1.25e23 kWh of energy to convert it to photons via matter-antimatter annihilation.

Using the relativistic rocket equation, assuming a spacecraft mass of 5t and accelerating at 1g, to reach 99.999999% speed of light would require approx 2.49e22 kWh energy.

askscience,"This is an \*excellent\* question, and is the basis of special relativity (it's called 'special' because it assumes a flat spacetime.)

Firstly, if your car has mass it can't travel at c ('c' is the symbol used to refer to the speed of light for historical reasons ). If you have mass, you can approach c but never reach it. It would take infinite energy and you would acquire infinite mass, so long before you reach c you become a black hole and that's general relativity (general because it applies in any spacetime) so it's not what we're talking about.

Anyway. That was a bit of a digression.

Let's take two people, Alice and Bob, who we shall call 'observers' because the observe things.

Alice is hurtling along the road at speed v past Bob who is standing on the side of the road.  Alice has her headlights on. Alice measures the speed the light leaves her car and discovers it is exactly c.

Bob measures the light from Alice's headlights and discovers it is moving at.....exactly c!

Shouldn't that be c+v? In a non-relativistic universe that's what you'd expect, but that's not where we (and Alice and Bob) live. We live here.

How can this be?

Alice's car is exactly 10m long (yes, she's driving a great barge of a thing.) She measured it very carefully before she set off. Bob has a very accurate car-length-measurer that he uses to find le length of Alice's car as it hurtles past. He measures it with great accuracy to be.....less than 10m!

Alice and Bob synchronise their very accurate wristwatches at the start of a section, then measure them at the end. Alice reads exactly 10s at the end of the section. Bob reads....slightly more than 10s!

How can that be?

In Special Relativity we talk about Reference Frames. Bob is in one reference frame, and Alice is in another. By accelerating to her current velocity Alice has shifted her reference Fram to one which Bob observes to have a slower flow of time, and shortened length along the direction of travel.

The accounts for why they both measure the speed of light to be the same. Time is flowing differently for Alice and Bob.  


When Alice stops and compares watches with Bob, less time has elapsed for Alice.

This has been measured to astonishing accuracy, and is one of the corrections made for GPS satellites.",ChazR,1635222823
askscience,"I don't think that's a good comparison. I think I see your point that in the case of the balloon you have a two dimensional surface embedded in a three dimensional world, but that just made the explanation intuitive.

It's more just like space is elastic and can stretch when it is pulled by gravity. Imagine you were swimming toward a finish line in some elastic goo and someone stretched out the goo: the distance to the finish line would be further away.


The goo could also be curved. Perhaps that means there exists a shorter path to your destination, but if you're only swimming in a straight line (like light) you have to follow the curve.

That also leads to a natural explanation of a black hole: if the goo is curved enough then it is possible no straight lines lead you to the finish line, and thus you would ""exit the goo"" i.e. ""enter the black hole"".",tim36272,1635222459

""Determines"" is a bit too direct of a relationship. But it does set a bare minimum standard that the design should withstand the established duration. 
Various building materials, and their interactions (not unlike chemical engineering) can shorten, or lengthen that duration. Concrete, for example is outstanding in compression, but lousy at sheer, steel is great at sheer, but buckles in compression (at least usable, standard structural shapes). But it's duration is dependant on multiple factors... is it near the ocean? Salt in the air can limit the duration. Basically... Steel hates it. Cold winter temperatures would also be a factor in most infrastructure. Not just the temperature effects the duration. Or time. But the use during that time. This could be why you see more mechanical products being replaced more than others. Their use, and the stresses it causes over periods of time.
Is it an exact science? We wanna believe so, if not to just have the courage to push forward. But, no. Years of learning evolves what we know to this day. Millions of buildings were built in earthquake zones, using standards that today... would be laughed out of permit applications. Most that simply gave no consideration to duration, yet... THOUSANDS of these buildings exist... being historic. What would, ""duration of load"" and natural factors say about some of the structures we still use, daily? Well, it might say that ancient structures, like the Roman coliseum, or the leaning tower of pisa* should have collapsed a LONG time ago. So... as much as we think we know... we are still not quite right.
*-note that there was extensive restoration at both sites referenced, including new engineering applied at Pisa to keep it leaning... the right way... and not in imminent danger of collapse. But that too has an end date. What then?

askscience,"Not a major issue, but Lord Kelvin's atomic model was the idea of aether vortices. That is not a plum pudding model, it's something different. Kelvin's idea was that the aether, the medium by which electromagnetic forces were conveyed, could be tied into localized knots, and what we perceived as matter was just made up of these knots. Thomson said, actually, it's not aether knots, it's all a single particle (the electron) that makes up matter, and that particle is what joins the world of aether to the world of matter. 

I also am not sure that ""most scientists"" believed strongly in either model. They were important atomic models but they were so speculative (Kelvin didn't really have any evidence for his, and Thomson's work showed that electrons existed but didn't really indicate that atoms were anything like he described).

To summarize the authors' interpretation of the cave's formation: There was a volcanic cone* on Ol Doinyo Lengai that once contained a lava lake. The lava lake emptied, leaving a void or conduit, with one or more branching passages. Renewed activity refilling this cave with lava further expanded it. Later, aqueous dissolution of the carbonates (like in lomestone), further expanded the cave and produced speleothems.

Before I go into it, the biggest thing you need to keep in mind is the meaning behind the speed of Casualty; that there is a max speed at which information can travel in our Universe.    
   
Short answer: They do but it doesn’t matter. Because you can’t force one of the entangled particles into a particular state AND any measurements will be dud as quantum measurements are random. 
    
Long answer: There’s something called the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle that tldr basically says the more you know about a particle’s Position, the less precisely it’s momentum can be predicted upwards to completely random. In other words, if you 100% measure where a particle is, it’s momentum will be completely random.    
     
This effectively means you can never know 100% information on particle; the more precisely you measure one part of it, the less precisely you can measure another. From what little I understand, you need both to be able to use Quantum entanglement for FTL communication.    
   
Now comes the problem of the speed of casualty limiting 2 parts of the Universe from talking to each other. 
     
Particle A is entangled with Particle B. Both particles are observed by their respective Scientists with a Positive Charge. Both particles/scientists are 1 Light Second apart (this distance doesn’t matter, it can be any observable distance except 0).   
    
Scientist A does some impossible super science and makes Particle A reverse it’s charge to Negative. Quantum entanglement means Particle B is now also Negative. Scientists B observes Particle B become Negative.    
    
The speed at which the information of this entanglement can be checked is still the Speed of Casualty. Scientist B cannot check Particle A’s state to verify the Negative charge any faster than C (light speed) and Scientist A cannot check on Particle B to confirm. This is because quantum measurements are random so some sort of verification needs to be done. This verification can only occur at the fastest at the speed of casualty.

askscience,"As a boson, light doesn't occupy space in the way we are used to with everyday fermionic matter. Boson's can occupy the same space at the same time. A laser is an example of this. If boson's had mass, laser pointers would feel pretty heavy when we turned them on!

If we think of force carrying particles like the photon as a single wave in a field, in this case the electromagnetic field, then there is no need for it to have mass. It is regular matter 'jiggling' about that creates these waves in the field (photons), and since every atom is always in motion due to thermodynamics, photons and other bosons are constantly being emitted by atoms. In fact, in that regard there is an infinite amount of bosons inside of any given atom.

Think of a wave in a pool displacing a ball. The wave itself may be comprised of physical things (water molecules) but the wave is not a part of the body of water. It only exists as energy being transferred over the surface of the medium (like light transferring energy through the field via photons). But we can quantify the energy transferred with each passing wave, we can denote a momentum to the wave. This momentum provides the force on the ball to move it over the surface of the water. It wasn't like the water reached over to move the ball, it just transferred its energy to the ball through the wave.

Earth orbital velocity is around 30 km/s and although it's only 0.01% of speed of light measuring such difference was well within capabilities of late 19th century scientists.

Planetary systems form from gravitationally shrinking clouds. Large clouds shrink faster in a few million years. Smaller clouds shrink much slower in tens to hundreds of millions of years. When stars eventually begin fusion, observation of protoplanetary disks suggest that exoplanets, as spherical lumps of stuff, have about 10 million years before stellar winds blow away the dust and clouds, stopping the accretion of more material onto the planets.

As your fraction of light speed approaches 100%, this term goes to infinity. You can check it by plugging in .9, .99 and ,999 for your light speed fractions and seeing that the Lorentz factor values are increasing by several multiples (2.3 vs 7.1 vs 22).

askscience,"There's a lot of half answers here, so I'm gonna point out that objects approaching the speed of light not only experience time slower but also begin to gain mass, and the energy being used to accelerate starts to get drained into inertia very quickly.

Then there's the other relativity issues. From the point of view of a photon travelling at c, a photon travelling at c in the other direction should be traveling at 2c, but that is faster than the speed of light so time stops and the photon travelling in the opposite direction doesn't move at all relative to the surroundings. Thus the velocity of the rest of the universe relative to the photon is c

For these reasons we believe it is impossible to accelerate matter to c. It would be better if those people just said *near* c though, because these effects start to kick in the second you have any velocity at all. Time slows down a little, you gain a little mass... By the time you get anywhere near c our current technology levels are just inadequate. CERN takes years to get single particles near c",Ulfbass,1635206048

The reason why we refer to very very high speeds as fractions of C is for exactly the reason you pointed out, small changes at that level really can have massive changes in energy and momentum. In fact, it turns out that the kinetic energy of something moving is actually determined its speed *in relation to* the speed of light, not the absolute value. At low speeds however, that fraction is so low that we don't have to worry about this effect. We can use a constant and normal units and still get very very accurate estimate of kinetic energy.

It's a similar strategy to  how we talk about very low temperatures. Because 0.0 K is the lower limit of temperature, scientists have to talk about temperatures close to 0.0 K as fractions of a degree like mili-kelvins (.001 K). It's a super small unit but what matters is knowing that .01 K is 10 times hotter than .001 K.

askscience,"&gt;What's the reference frame where a bar magnet actually generates an electric force instead of a magnetic force?

In a frame in which the magnet is moving, there will generally be an electric field.

When you're introduced to the fact that electric and magnetic fields transform into each other under the Lorentz transformations, it's usually through an example where you have some stationary distribution of charge, and when you boost into another frame, the now-moving charge constitutes a current, and therefore there must be a magnetic field in this frame.

And that's true, but it leads to this misconception that every magnetic field is just an electric field in another frame, or that magnetic fields are ""because of"" electric fields and relativity.

But if you really think about that, that's totally contrary to the whole point of relativity: that no inertial frame is special. In the example above of the stationary charge, there happens to exist a frame where *only* an electric field exists. And in any other frame, there is both an electric and magnetic field. But that doesn't mean that the frame with the purely electric field is ""more correct"" than the others, nor does it mean that the electric field is ""more fundamental"" than the magnetic.

You can just as well come up with an example of a system where there's always a magnetic field, and not always an electric field. Your example of a permanent magnet is such a system, in fact.

In natural units, **B**^(2) - **E**^(2) is a Lorentz-invariant quantity. In the rest frame of the magnet, there is only a magnetic field, and no electric field. So in that frame, **B**^(2) - **E**^(2) = **B**^(2) &gt; 0.

If you then boost into some other frame with fields **B**' and **E**', **B**'^(2) - **E**'^(2) must have the same value, so it needs to be positive in any frame. Therefore there cannot exist any frame where the magnetic field is zero, or else that quantity would have to be negative, and then couldn't equal the positive number **B**^(2) in the rest frame of the magnet.

So not only is it not particularly useful to think of the magnetic field of the permanent magnet as ""an electric field in a different frame"", it's not *possible at all* to find a frame where the field is purely electric.

The magnet is magnetic because on a microscopic level, the particles that make it up have magnetic dipole moments, and strong enough interactions that most of the dipole moments in the system tend to align in a certain direction, giving the magnet a net magnetization. So in the rest frame of the magnet, it has a magnetic field. No need to think about electric fields at all, unless for some reason you need to boost into a frame where the magnet is moving.

&gt;I know magnetism in ""classical"" magnets and things like iron is due to the spin of electrons and if ""spin"" in QM actually meant ""spin"" in the usual sense, it'd made perfect sense how this is ultimately the same thing as how electromagnets work. But it's been emphasized to me MANY times that the ""spin"" of a particle does NOT mean the particle is actually spinning, but instead spin it's own separate property that doesn't have a classical analog. OK, so then how does it have the same effect on the E field at an atomic level as macroscopic movement does to the E field on a macroscopic level? To be clear, I'm not disputing that ""spin"" doesn't mean the particle is actually spinning. I'm just very confused about a force generated by some mysterious quantum property with no classical analog is the same as the force generated by electromagnetics.

People love to get up in arms about whether the spin of a particle means that it's ""spinning"", but the issue is not whether the answer to that question is ""Yes"" or ""No"", it's what does ""spinning"" actually mean in a quantum system? It's ambiguous, and turns out to be of little importance to actually doing any physics. Spin is just the intrinsic angular momentum that a quantum system carries with it. We have a very detailed understanding of what it is mathematically.

Particles which have both spin and charge have a magnetic moment, and therefore produce a magnetic field in their rest frame.",RobusEtCeleritas,1635202240

In some species, these imaginal discs remain dormant throughout the caterpillar's life; in other species, the discs begin to take the shape of adult body parts even before the caterpillar forms a chrysalis or cocoon.

Every ""tick"" of time produces aN instance of wave that goes in all directions. If the object is too fast he will produce waves that will never catch up to it.

If it still tries to speed the waves the energy will just be wasted into heat.

The waves would sound higher pitched when compressed. An observer in the ground would also experience the Doppler effect because some waves never catch up to others while others are compressed. Modulating the pitch.",gorebello,1635200145

askscience,"You absolutely can increase your metabolism with certain foods!  Foods high in capsaicin have been shown to elevate basal metabolic rate when consumed in high quantities - the equivalent of several pounds of peppers per day.  Other edible things (I didn't want to necessarily say 'foods') that contain stimulants, such as the leaves of the coca plant, can also increase metabolic rate.

So if you eat spicy foods that have a lot of natural stimulants, you can definitely increase your metabolic rate...but your heart might give out from all the coca leaves first.

Why does this happen?  Well, your metabolic rate is the sum of all the chemical processes your body has going on at any one time.  Increasing exergonic, or energy releasing reactions, leads to more energy being expended.  Stimulants, for example, usually bind to adranergic receptors on the heart, causing increased heart rate - it takes energy to make the heart pump, so that increases metabolism.  It isn't like there's a single big switch that says ""increase metabolism"" - it's a bunch of relatively small changes adding up.

Chances are that if you're interested in boosting your metabolism with food, eat foods that are higher in fiber And lower in fats.  It takes energy to digest and absorb food, up to about 10% of our metabolic rate.  Spending more energy digesting food is probably the only practically feasible way to increase metabolism via food without putting your health at risk.",xgrayskullx,1635198350

This isn’t so with mmr, it’s still a thing but it isn’t active pandemic levels like covid. It’s easier to fight off a disease with the antibodies already there. It’s like the difference between the cops being called or a sting operation - do you prefer the cops to be called in or already there while the crime is happening. Well if the crime doesn’t happen often, it’s okay we wait to call them. But if the crime is going to happen in this specific place at this specific time, you’d want them already there. So we want to make sure the antibodies are there right now for this specific disease, waiting to sting- while MMR isn’t as prevalent so we can wait to call on those antibodies if the need arises.

Most soils cannot absorb more than like 2-4 inches in an hour so anything more will run off. Run off will still contribute to a reservoir's water supply if it has fallen in its watershed. However, moisture held in the soil like a sponge is really what alleviates drought conditions. 

A massive storm delivering many inches of rain may bring a drought stricken area to average rainfall levels but the actual soil moisture will depend on how it has been delivered.

How is this possible? Well you have to account for time dilation. In your frame of reference, your acceleration is constant.

askscience,"So, at the most general level, water delivery of course helps drought, but the extent to which a single, large intensity event helps more or less than the equivalent amount of water spread out over a longer time is actually a tricky question and depends on a lot of local details. Let's try to pull it apart a bit.

Two of the important variables to consider are antecedent soil moisture (i.e., how wet was the soil before the rain event) and the infiltration rate of the soil (i.e., how quickly can water enter the soil and move through it). Together, these two parameters will generally control how much water delivered by rain to the land surface infiltrates vs runs off (and enters the stream network, where in the absence of major reservoir system, we can consider it ""lost"" in terms of storage). There are lots of influences on these two parameters, e.g., local climate, vegetation type and density, time of year (as this can influence how the vegetation is using water), etc. If we think specifically about how these parameters interact as a function of rainfall intensity and duration, the picture gets complicated fast. For really large magnitude rainfall events, there's data to suggest that somewhat paradoxically, antecedent soil moisture doesn't actually matter that much, whereas it's very important for how much water runs off for more moderate to mild rainfall events (e.g., [Castillo et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169403002646), [Zhang et al., 2011](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/15/3171/2011/)) and the general expectation for these lower intensity events is that high antecedent soil moisture (i.e., saturated soil) means more runoff and less infiltration. This suggests that for high intensity rainfall, the infiltration rate (or hydraulic conductivity) of the soil is going to be the more dominant control on how much water infiltrates vs runs off. In detail though, this again is influenced by a lot of things, both in terms of the particular environment (e.g., infiltration rates seem to vary as a function of position on a hillslope, e.g., [Dunne et al., 1991](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/91WR01585)) and the particular event (e.g., infiltration rates are different for same total magnitude of rainfall over the same total time interval depending on whether the rate within the event decreases with time, increases with time, or is constant through the event, e.g., [Dunkerely, 2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hyp.8317)). With specific reference to high intensity events, it also appears that there is a negative correlation between hydraulic conductivity and rainfall intensity, i.e., as the rainfall rate increases, the rate at which water infiltrates decreases (e.g., [Liu et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169410006517), [Langhans et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169411000199)). This implies that generally, large events like the one California experienced are not efficient at delivering a lot of water that will be stored. The added effect in much of California is that recently burned areas are known to have generally lower infiltration rates than unburned areas (e.g., [Martin &amp; Moody, 2001](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.380)), so the timing of the storm relative to the fire season also becomes a factor in recently burned areas. 

**In short,** generally, given all of the above (and with a lot of really big caveats given the importance of local details and the diversity of environments within California), the expectation would be that the delivery of a given magnitude of water in a single, intense and short duration rainfall event leads to less water infiltrating and being stored in the groundwater system than the same magnitude of water delivered over a long period of time. Details start to become important though as the role of antecedent soil moisture becomes greater for the lower intensity storms, so to maximize the amount of water that infiltrates, you would want low to moderate intensity storms sufficiently spaced out such that antecedent soil moisture is not high (i.e., the soil has time to become unsaturated before the next event). This is all also predicated on thinking about rainfall specifically. Significant snowfall means that more of the water can be stored and released, either in a late fall snowmelt event (e.g., another major rainstorm with rain-on-snow) or in spring snowmelt. The other relevant caveat is that I'm not a hydrologist, and while I think a lot about runoff generating mechanisms (as this is critical for studying how rivers erode, which is more my specialty), there are likely important details I'm overlooking.",CrustalTrudger,1635185276

askscience,"By heating the material to a very high temperature so you have individual atoms that are partly ionized. Most atoms will have lost one or two electrons. You then use an electric field to accelerate them into a beam (in vacuum) and a magnetic field to bend the beam. Where the atoms end up depends on the ratio between the mass of the atom and the charge of the electrons. Even if you dont know the electron charge, this will give the relative mass of the atoms.

Alternative:  react a known amount with eg oxygen or something similar and measure how much heavier it gets. Since the ratio between the different elements in the oxide is usually simple numbers, you can reconstruct the mass of the atoms in the original element relative to the mass of oxygen.

askscience,"If you say something that isn't a massless particle or wave traveling through a vacuum is moving ""at the speed of light,"" then you are definitely wrong. The speed of light, _c_, is sort of like a ""speed limit"" of the universe - it's the speed at which information can travel through space-time. That's why we can't just round numbers to _c_.

Since the speed of light is a fundamental constant, meaning that it's a number that has a set value and that defines the behavior of the universe, it shows up in a lot of physics formulas and is used as a reference for very large velocities. It's easier to say 0.9999c than it is to say 299762478.8m/s. It's also more meaningful, because 0.9999c tells you something interesting about the velocity in terms of how close it is to the fastest possible velocity.

You are right in saying that to accelerate a massive particle to _close_ to the speed of light requires finite energy. You can always go a little closer to c by adding more energy to the particle. You just can't ever actually reach c.",6thReplacementMonkey,1635182575

This is why you can see someone's torch light even if you stand off to the side.
2. It is absorbed by an electron (some conditions are required for this) and remitted. This remitted photon can go in any direction - so if it were to be shot further into the wall, it will hit one of these two steps again.

The best way to think about this is to know that every atom wants to be electrically neutral. Electrons are negatively charged, and have the exact same charge as a proton, just with the opposite sign. So for a neutral atom, every electron needs a partner proton in the nucleus to make the overall electric field as close to neutral as possible (nature tends to low energy and neutral fields are in a low potential energy state).

The question now is how did we figure out we figured out how many electrons were in an atom. I love the history behind this.

askscience,"The speed of light in water is C (sorta), but that C is 75% of the speed of light in a vacuum. So C doesnt change per se, its the speed of light, but  the actually velocity is dependant on the material.

In the same we speak of the speed of sound, but that speed is different in different materials.

This is why there is a thing called Cherenkov Radiation, which is a spooky blue light, its the light emitted by (usually) electrons going FASTER than the speed of light, but the speed of light in a non vacuum. So you will see the blue radiation coming out of a radiation source that is in water, because C in water is 75% of C in a vacuum, and the electrons are going 76% or more of the speed of C in a vacuum.",Thecna2,1635175061

askscience,"&gt;There doesn't seem to even be much information on fatigue and how it's calculated.

Engineering students learn about fatigue in their first machine design classes. Look up any book with ""machine design"" or ""design of machine elements"" in the title, and most likely it will have a chapter on fatigue, including how to design (calculate) machine elements with respect to fatigue. Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design is one of the more popular books.

Fatigue is a problem when a part experiences dynamic loading (meaning, stress changes over time). That means that fatigue is of most concern in machines which have rotating or reciprocating elements under load, (shafts, gears, tools, ...). Structures such as bridges experience far less dynamic loading, so fatigue doesn't affect them as much.

That being said, you can design parts to have basically infinite life. Steel in particular. If the load on the part is much lower than the strength of that material, part can have (virtually)  infinite life.",Scuka1,1635174610

askscience,"The momentum and energy of an object increase without bound as it gets closer to the speed of light.  Let's take momentum, which is a good measure of how hard the object will hit something.

Let's take our reference point at 10% of the speed of light.

An object going at 20% the speed of light will have twice as much momentum as it did at 10%.  Twice the speed, twice the momentum, makes sense.  Except it's actually 2.03 times, due to the relativity factor.

At 30%, it'll have 3.13 times the momentum as at 10%.

At 50%, it's 5.75 times.

askscience,"There are a lot of good answers  here talking about the exponential increase in in energy requirements with even a slight increase in the speed of travel

I will provide a the time dilation perspective of it.
If an object is moving at 99.99% the speed of light for a period of 1 year then for a stationary observer on earth his journey will have taken close to 70 years. Whereas if he was moving at 99.999% the speed of light ,the same journey would take close to 220 years from the point of view of an observer on earth .

That's a 150 year difference with just a .009% points increase. You can imagine as you go further on, how exponentially higher the difference becomes

The relativistic formula for time dilation has a term for the squared ratio of an objects speed to the speed of light,  and this term is highly sensitive to even the slightest increase in an objects velocity the closer you get to the speed of light. 
Thus it is very important in physics to be very very accurate about the decimal representation of the speed of an object, traveling near the speed of light.

askscience,"Some materials have a fatigue limit, which is a cyclic stress below which the material has effectively infinite life (this is typically defined as at least 10^6 cycles). This includes, broadly speaking, steel and titanium alloys. On the other hand, aluminum and many other non-ferrous alloys continually decrease in allowable stress with increasing cycles without reaching an asymptote.

This is the conventional understanding of fatigue life that is taught in undergraduate mechanical engineering classes, at least as of about 10 years ago. [But there is research suggesting that fatigue limits don't really exist even for ferrous and titanium alloys](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1460-2695.1999.00183.x) and that being able to withstand a particular level of stress out to 10^6 cycles doesn't mean you won't fail at 10^8 or 10^9. Given that the concept of the fatigue limit was established roughly in the early 1900s, you can see that it would have been difficult at that time to test cyclic loading out to a billion cycles. At one Hz, that takes almost 32 years of continuous operation. And there is some question about whether modern piezoelectric solutions which can cycle at 20 kHz - reducing your 32 years to about 14 hours - introduce frequency dependence and heat dissipation effects that may not be relevant to real world cyclic loading.",Coomb,1635173080

askscience,"&gt;I know that during normal operation jet aircraft use air compressors to scavenge oxidizer from the atmosphere, but I'm wondering if there's ever a use case for carrying extra oxidizer on a jet aircraft.

Maybe, but it's very limited, to the extent that we haven't found it.

&gt;For example, suppose you had a fuel system that could dump more fuel into the combustion chamber than the air compressor could manage, you could add extra oxidizer directly to the combustion maybe for a higher performance boost than would normally be possible with a purely air-breathing engine.

The constraint on thrust generation and fuel burning is almost universally a materials science constraint on the components in the combustion chamber and the initial stages of the high pressure turbine. Fuel burns far hotter than is tolerable by existing materials - especially if you're moving very quickly and you get a lot of compression heating - so the amount of fuel we can burn is limited by our ability to keep the engine components cool. It wouldn't help to be able to inject oxidizer to burn additional fuel because we're already burning as much fuel as we can.

&gt;Or for another example, what if an aircraft at very high altitude wasn't able to scavenge enough oxygen to fully generate the thrust it wanted/needed.

If you want to operate at altitudes above about 100,000 ft, and depending on your mission profile you're almost certainly better off with either a balloon or a dedicated rocket plane.

___

The main issue your concept has is that by carrying along oxidizer, you've just turned your jet into a rocket. But that means you lose many of the advantages of using a jet in the first place, because you're hauling around oxidizer all the time, and with your suggested mission profiles you're not even using it for most of the flight. That's wasted weight and wasted volume. While periodically there are concepts of mixed propulsion aircraft, some of which even make it to flight (e.g. SNCASO SO.9000 Trident), they're generally worse at whatever they're trying to do than something that's designed specifically to do that. [Reaction Engines has been working on SABRE and predecessor concepts for decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABRE_(rocket_engine\)) without making an effective combined cycle jet and rocket engine.",Coomb,1635172150
askscience,"So to break it down, you probably already know that the speed of light is an important physical constant that represents the upper limit of information travel. This means that things such as photons, gravity waves or field perturbations have to travel at this speed due to their nature.  However, a distinct property of these phenomena is that they travel at 'c' no matter what reference frame you're in.

Whereas a car could travel at 60km/h but if you were to drive beside it at 40km/h, it has a relative speed of 20km/h to you.

So when papers write 0.99c, the distinction is important because it indicates that the object/particle is not in this category. So neutrinos, for example, whilst they travel extremely fast and have a lot of the relativistic effects that light would have, they do not cross that threshold and therefore do not have those extra properties.",IBEKEVINN,1635172092

askscience,"Its not impossible, I guess, but its unlikely. Generally speaking (and there will be exceptions) the 'max thrust' of a jet engine is limited by the EGT of an engine. EGT, Exhaust Gas Temperatures, is  the temperature of the gases exiting the turbine. Jet Engines are limited by the maximum EGT they can reach, because any temp much higher will melt the turbine blades and vanes. So whacking in some Nitrous Oxide would produce more thrust all right, but it would also melt the blades and vanes, then you will have no thrust, and a downward descent will be compulsorily initiated. There are of course safety factors built in, it would be dangerous to routinely run your exhaust gases (from the combustion area) at a few degrees below the melting point of the metal bits just behind it, but there is not much leeway to get a burst from adding an oxidiser. This is why jets use an afterburner to get more power, its more like just a straight flame out the back, but uses masses of fuel.

Conventional piston engines usually have physical limitations of the rotating parts and the huge engineering stresses that are exerted, as long as you dont breach those you're alright. Enthusiastic nitrous oxide use is a great way to destroy an engine, which is something you try and avoid at 30,000 feet.


Very high altitude is a different thing, the SR71 used its afterburner at very high speed and  altitude but I dont think there was an attempt to actually add an oxidiser of any sort for it or other high altitude aircraft. I'll have a poke around though.",Thecna2,1635171774

askscience,"So, let's imagine that you're an industrious person and you, somehow, eat a star.  You use that energy to accelerate up to 99.99% of light speed (just spitballing here.)

Let's also imagine there's nothing around.  All around you is void, nothing to measure yourself against.  You throw something ahead of yourself and it seems to go faster than you are, and you shine a light at it and it goes out and bounces back at 'c'.  How fast are you going?  It looks like you're not even moving.

So you take another star out of your magic pocket and you eat that too, and you accelerate further.  You feel like you accelerated, again, to 99.99% of lightspeed, but, again, it looks like you're not even moving.  You do the same experiment again, and get the same results.

Now, obviously, an observer who was originally stationary with respect to you is going to see you get closer and closer to c, and you're going to look stranger and stranger.  But from your perspective, no matter how much you've accelerated, no matter how many magic sources of energy you consume, and no matter how many times you accelerate to 99.99% of c, you can always go faster.

That's why c is impossible to reach, even with infinite energy.",Tarhish,1635171627
askscience,"The rapidity is not a transformation, it is a (not Lorentz invariant) quantity associated with a velocity. It's effectively a ""hyperbolic angle"" of the four-velocity -- it measures the amount of boost required to transform a four-vector aligned with the time axis so that it's aligned with the four-velocity, the same way an angle measures the amount of rotation required to align two vectors.

The reason it is a more natural measure of velocity is that it is linear in boosts along the same spatial direction. No more velocity addition formulas -- at least as long as you're working in R^(1+1). 

As you might expect (as a consequence of the non-compactness of the Lorentz group), the rapidity goes off to infinity as the velocity approaches c. This encapsulates the intuition that it gets ""harder and harder"" to get closer to c, which can be unintuitive to grasp, as OP has found. But the underlying reason for this behaviour is because velocity is just not a natural kinematic measure in SR. So instead of saying ""It gets harder and harder to accelerate as you approach c"", which makes it sound like the Universe is pushing back on you like a stop sign, it's more accurate to say that ""Velocity doesn't space the tickmarks evenly"" when it comes to energy and momentum.

As highlighted in [Shugar et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2932), this is talking about a small tributary to the Yukon River, not the Yukon itself. This is an example of [stream capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_capture), i.e., the drainage area of one river is ""captured"" by another and as a result, the downstream portion of the ""losing"" tributary experiences a reduction in discharge, and in an extreme case like this, can result in that tributary running dry. Now both of the things you're highlighting (i.e., the reduction in Salmon population and this particular stream capture event) have been linked to climate change. For the latter, the argument is that the retreat of the Kaskawulsh Glacier allowed for the Kaskawulsh River (which flows into the Alsek River and then into the Pacific) to capture a portion of the drainage area of the Slims River (a tributary to the Yukon). This capture caused the Slims River to dry up (as the glacial meltwater feeding it was now flowing in the Kaskawulsh). This does lead to a reduction in drainage area (and thus discharge) into the Yukon, but the Yukon is a massive river with hundreds of tributaries feeding it, so a single capture like this does have an effect, but not some sort of devastating one as you're envisioning.",CrustalTrudger,1635168543

askscience,"It depends, planetary formation is still relatively new science and isn’t fully understood. To date, we have only confirmed over 4,000 exoplanets (although there are thousands of submissions to be explored still). In short and extremely generalized terms, it takes millions of years for planets to form. For a planet to form, a star needs to have a accretion disk surrounding it. The accretion disk allows the excess material that wasn’t incorporated into the star to clump together to start the formation of planets. It’s believed that gas giants form first and rocky planets follow after. For example, Jupiter is believed to have formed in roughly ~3 million years (Myr) and Porto-earth is believed to have formed in [~5Myr](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aay7604). 

Some factors to consider when a planet forms is how massive the star is, how many [stars](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2021/10/05/weve-found-the-first-planet-to-orbit-three-stars-say-scientists/amp/) there are, and the amount of material in the accretion disk. More massive stars emit greater amounts of radiation and provide a harsher environment for planets. In recent research, giant planets in one system formed in potentially [=&lt; 1 Myr](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2018/02/aa31978-17.pdf). 

So overall, the average amount of time a planet takes to form is highly variable because of the different star classifications, material present in accretion disk and planet classifications.",Schmidty654,1635164978

askscience,"&gt;Also I know that in order to accelerate anything with mass to speed c, it would require infinite energy, but to accelerate to 0.9999c would that require finite energy?

Yes. Although I don't like saying ""would require infinite energy"", because I think people don't take the word ""infinite"" seriously enough (e.g. someone might ask ""okay, so if I had an infinite source of energy, could I reach the speed of light?""). I would just say that it's totally possible accelerate as close as you like to the speed of light, and it takes more energy the closer you get. But, without using speculative unknown physics, it's not possible for any object with mass to actually reach the speed of light.

Once you get close to the speed of light, the energy required increases *asymptotically* (it goes roughly like 1/sqrt(x)) with speed. This means than going from 99% to 99.99% costs ten times more energy, going from 99.99% to 99.9999% costs ten times that again, and going from 99.9999% to 99.999999% costs ten ten times *that*. So each time you increase your energy by a factor of 10, you accelerate by a smaller and smaller amount.

This is somewhat true at lower speeds - it takes more energy to accelerate from 50 mph to 100 mph than to go from 0 mph to 50 mph. But as you approach the speed of light, the amount of extra energy you need to accelerate by a certain amount goes up really dramatically, so that you never reach the speed of light, no matter how much energy you add.",Astrokiwi,1635164814

A massive object object can go arbitrarily close to the speed of light.

The point is that a massive object can't go at the speed of light so it wouldn't be a well posed problem if you assume it's travelling at the speed of light.

There's a comparatively big difference in the magnitude of relativistic effects between 99.99% the speed of light and 99.999% the speed of light (The gamma factors are 71 and 223 respectively). It's useful to consider the rapidity artanh(v/c) instead of the velocity v at that point which (in terms of absolute value) ranges from 0 to ∞. The rapidity for the first one is 4.95 for the second one it's 6.10. 90% the speed of light is a rapidity of 1.47.",lettuce_field_theory,1635157496

askscience,"I could put all of that down to personal difference of experience.    


The pragmatic thing to do 'from your viewpoint', is to get vaccinated.  I would wager that you'd consider any of their concerns pretty much null and void and claim science backs your viewpoint.  This is the experience most of those people have had, I'd wager as well... supposedly well-meaning, but ultimately domineering and angry people telling them that if they don't do the 'pragmatic' and 'realistic' thing (also the thing that's self serving for anyone that isn't them), then they're just flat horrible selfish people.   


I try to consider that angle, because so many don't.  Not speaking to you, specifically on this, but I've talked to other people who are gung ho vaccine supporters and had to tell them 'Just because you're right... doesn't mean you have to be a douche about it or force how correct you are on others'.  Also, you might NOT be.  There's ALWAYS that chance, however small.   


Mandates kind of ARE wrong from a western point of view, at least from the outset.  They're NOT actively law, which ideally means that you COULD circumvent them, but they ARE enforced, at least partially by social pressure even when not physically so, which means they're enforcing a not-law.  Legally speaking that... makes no sense.   


I would suspect that plenty of people WOULD make that argument to you, you've probably just already considered their arguments negated for other reasons, OR they don't know how to articulate it to you.  Tensions are high on this issue.   


I keep reminding people... if the RIGHT course WAS so obvious... why do we have such a HUGE level of disagreement with it?  It's always safest to assume you're NOT right, even when you're pretty sure you are, because that'll be when someone comes and slaps you with an argument that actually demolishes your position, if you haven't considered alternatives.   


That said, MOSTLY everyone in this thread has been reasonable about considering alternative viewpoints and not being jerks about it, which is.. surprising. And refreshing.",kyraeus,1635147243
askscience,"Big difference is that I've yet to see a vaccine mandate that was unconditional.   

Every one has the vaccine as a precondition to doing some activity that involves interaction with others, which is where the vaccine becomes a matter of public health.    
You always have the choice to not get it.  You just can't be a nurse, teacher, cop, firefighter, attend public schools, or do other activities that involve close contact with large numbers of people.       

None of them were complaining about the MMR vaccine being mandatory for those same things, so I find it a bit disingenuous that they draw the line here.",ricecake,1635147148

I only encounter people who think mandates are wrong, and also don't think vaccines are helpful, and deny that covid is a problem.

It's a pretty straight mental shot to say that if women have bodily autonomy, that's a right that should be afforded to everyone.

For those who agree with vax mandates, they see the priority of group safety 'overriding' that of individual rights.  For these others, it's exactly the opposite... The government is making demands of what they can and can't do with their own body.  It IS absolutely the case in a very real way. That's what a vaccine mandate IS.  

They see arguing for mandates as right to choose being denied on an almost global scale, and it's only reasonable to acknowledge that even if you disagree, that's physically true. Their right to body autonomy IS being denied... you just believe that the reason for it is worthwhile, while they don't.",kyraeus,1635141778
